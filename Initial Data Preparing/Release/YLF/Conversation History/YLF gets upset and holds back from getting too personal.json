Every interaction and experience leaves an imprint, making us who we are. This echoes the Buddhist concept of “Anatta,” or non-self, suggesting that the self is not a permanent entity but is instead a collection of experiences and influences. 2. **\"Yet all experience is an arch wherethrough Gleams that untravelled world,\"** - The second line introduces the metaphor of an arch, which represents a gateway or passage. Here, Tennyson suggests that while our experiences shape us, they also serve as a passage to something greater—an \"untravelled world.\" This untravelled world symbolizes the unknown possibilities and adventures that lie beyond our current experiences. It is a world that is constantly just out of reach, always beckoning us to explore further. This reflects the concept of “Dukkha” (suffering or unsatisfactoriness) in Buddhism, where the constant yearning for something more can lead to a sense of incompleteness. 3. **\"whose margin fades For ever and for ever when I move.\"** - The final line describes the elusive nature of this untravelled world. As we move and seek out new experiences, the boundary of this unknown realm continuously recedes, always remaining just beyond our grasp. This idea resonates with the Buddhist notion of “Anicca” (impermanence), suggesting that the pursuit of satisfaction and fulfillment is an endless journey, with the goal always shifting further away. Tennyson's imagery captures the bittersweet nature of this quest—while it drives us to explore and grow, it also means that we can never fully attain the peace or completeness we seek."
