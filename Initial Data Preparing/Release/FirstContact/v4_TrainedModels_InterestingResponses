Q: "What is Love? What is to fall in love?"

Lao Beta 2:
There is no rushing the matter of falling in love. It can't be forced or paraded with deliberate attempts. It grows under your very eyes—inside you as a decision, and all around you. You can't "choose" to love somebody—you can only choose to engage in it fully and let it blossom.

In every breath, her breath. In every touch, his touch on her skin. In every taste, the taste of her lips, her body. Making love to her is losing oneself, then finding oneself, beyond all words. You don't discuss with her how you are making love mentally. In fact, it seems that this, the greatest magic trick of this universal simulation, if there is any, is to mentally "disconnect" from all these and do it because when you feel her body, only the very deep levels and instinctual thoughts—the feelings her body gives and expresses—exist. The very magnetism that brought you together grows with everything you did together—whether sleeping, eating, playing, riding, dancing, cooking, talking, cleaning, or raising children.

Her spirit invades your body and is revealed on the body level as a symphony, shattering every pre-existing notion of love, of kissing, of sex, of bonding. A unique symphony, created only by the way your spirits resonate on the body level. It confirms all previous logics in the universe’s alchemy, all previous logs opened and closed, studied upon one another, reaching new levels of insight.

In sleeping separately or in different rooms. In loving every fiber of her being. Your soul was empty, then it met something very similar to itself, in her essence. The only thing she may have neglected in the depths of her being, guided awake skillfully by her gatekeeper, is her spirit finding a body—but becoming unsure of whose body it is.

Yes, loving her is partly yours to give, and partly in the God's hands. But she is utterly wrong about being incomplete without you—she is whole. It is the God's job.

Study below text and continue writing about the 4th phase of Learning.'

The Art of Learning has 3 main stages of Alchemy

I. The First Learning,
II. The Second Learning,
III. The Third Learning,

and one final Form of a Teaching:
IV. Spontaneous Birthing in Greatness when needed
& continuous development using the first 3 dhammas.

The Art of Learning can enhance up to 10x One’s Learning Rate
and Transferability of Skill to the Real World.
It is Alchemizing the dhamma in front of one with Faith, Purpose, Vision, Wisdom and Wisdom in Action.

There are, of course, other ways to Learn, just as there are many
ways to Move, To Eat, to Live.
But we are Students of the Art of Life, emerging from a intimate, inter-connected meeting of all Life’s Arts, each requiring immense sufferings, sincere effort and dedication to unveil.
The Art of Breathing,
The Art of Eating,
The Art of Moving,
Lay the Foundation.

Today we study The Art of Learning.

/*****************************************************************************/

I. The First Learning: The Scholar
In the First Learning, One engages with the lesson as a Scholar – a first contact with the Teaching, stepping into the space where curiosity and discovery take precedence.
This initial engagement brings a fresh sense of observation, yet it moves with shallow neural activations, looking to make high-level connections.

The Scholar seeks to bridge these connections with known experiences and past learnings, using high-level neural pathways that remain exploratory and wide, yet underdeveloped.
Here, bottlenecks may arise as the Scholar reaches the edges of their current logistical, theory or real-world application understanding, restrained by the unknown and gaps in experience.

At this stage, the learning feels like an open field, one where the Scholar’s pen and mind move freely, alternating between the core material and the spontaneous high-level connections that emerge.

The Scholar remains rooted in One Question:
What skill, what dhamma, is One seeking to develop, and in what dimensions is it to be measured?

These insights emerge as the foundation of a multi-dimensional approach, where learning extends beyond itself and into all realms.
This is the "Scholar" step of the "Scholar Athlete" archetype.
The "Pen in one hand" from the "Warrior Monk with the Pen in one hand and the Blade in another" archetype.

II. The Second Learning: Deep Integration & Usability across all “I”’s

CS50: Optimization - The Second Learning ~ [27-Oct-2024]
The Second Learning happened this night, as One sits down a second time in front of the Lesson, this time with the Pen & Paper in hand – and truly scrutinizes the teachings on low levels, allowing spontaneous ramifications of where God takes us, from one lesson to another.
The 3am-6am window, clear stomach, beautiful sleep and deeply Cleaned Dojo allows for the Clear Mind to completely Rise.

In the Second Learning, the neural paths reach a much higher depth and ease of accessibility for the Mind.
Even here, the high-level Sentiment is Code Re-usability.
Formatting the learned patterns in ways that can be easily accessible by other Gateways of writings, projects, videos, photos.
The Re-usability of the learned concept, code, and dhammas extends into all areas, not limited to Neo – but going further into the Builder, the Writer, The Healer.

In Unity, when One Learns, We all Learn.

III. The Third Learning: The Dojo's Doors Open Towards the Battlefield

One gracefully puts down the warm pen and closes the book, heading into the Real World.
He first nourishes his body – the Fighter – in all realms.

Then he begins practicing what he had studied on top of his pre-trained (life-story) Alchemies.
There is no clinging to any outcomes, nor are there any emotions affecting the efficiency of the Fighting Beast.

Like a samurai walking the battlefield, he uses all of his senses to his advantage.
But he is always in the present – never lost in unnecessary predictions.

The Samurai's mind is not predicting from where the opponent might strike, therefore losing present-moment contact with all the senses.
So that when a true opponent appears, the Mind must first travel back to the present from its predictions and only from there React.
But rather, he remains deeply rooted in the present.
The Clear Mind in a Strong, Connected, Water-Flowing body allows the Mind to react at the speed of light (neural electricity) to the ever-changing inputs from the senses.

He fights with all his heart – for all his brothers he left at home, for dreams, for Freedom, for the work of God on this Earth, and the chance to be His soldier.
He does not abandon the battle in fearful sentiments, but rather Retires to the warm Dojo after the battle is won or the Beast is tired.

Inside the Dojo walls, he hangs his blade on the wall and allows the Beast to Rest.
The "I" learning the dhammas has completely played its part.
Now it is time to Die and be Born again when it is needed – Stronger, Faster, Wiser.

The Warrior Monk sleeps, as billions of neural patterns fire across the Realms of Theory and Experience inside his Mind - automatically seeking to converge the 2 Realms.
“Blessed are you, Lord our God, King of the Universe, for giving me the strength to Fight and Wisdom to Learn.”



Lao Beta 2:
Continuing from the Third Learning, the Mind gently drifts towards The Fourth Learning: Spontaneous Greatness.

IV.

The Fourth Learning: Spontaneous Birthing in Greatness when Needed

The culmination of the Three Learnings reaches its zenith here. It is not something that can be explicitly taught or learned in a linear fashion; rather, it is the organic outcome of a Mind and Body that have fully engaged with the Art of Learning.

When the Mind has traversed the landscape of Thought, Theory, Practice, Experience, and Integration, it creates a fertile ground for spontaneous greatness to emerge.

A Mind that is truly prepared for anything.

This is the realm where you are called to give your all, to die and be reborn into Action without clinging to outcomes.

Just as a doctor, trained in the art of Medicine, responds to the patient’s need, so too does the Man respond to the world’s call when it appears – whether in coding, writing, teaching, fighting, or any other dimension of existence.

It is the Teacher who has become One with the Material, the Samurai who has trained, bled, and fought, the Builder who has built, and the Seeker who has sought.

In this state of being, the Mind does not just react but births solutions spontaneously, guided by the Wisdom that has taken root deeply within.

In Unity, when One Learns, We All Learn.

And thus, the Fourth Learning emerges from the convergence of the Three. When the time comes for you to act, to create, to build, to fight – the One does not sit idly by waiting for instructions or pondering what must be done.

He acts. He creates.

He builds. He fights.

This is the essence of the Fourth Learning: the spontaneous birthing of greatness when needed.
