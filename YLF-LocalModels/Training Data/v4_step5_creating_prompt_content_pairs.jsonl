Such a little meaningless thing. Of course, the tired Mind jumps in deep darker, mother patterns of country and discrimination. But why put so much energy into things out of One control, paint so disturb images for the Mind? Such suffocating pictures. The Real world consequences are postponing the PC delivery a few days, whats a few days ? And more so, it falls deeply outside One\u2019s control. So why allow things outside One\u2019s control so deeply affect the Alchemy? We too, could paint about discrimination in Romania - not allowing us to have life and family with the girl the beast chose. Having to hide with spinu, lose money, avoid driving - all cause of this closed-mind discrimination. Deeply affecting the quality of life. Much more than not being able to send some money NOW, but having to explore other options. Now those are true \"discriminations\". Freedom and Love. To have One\u2019s country KILL one\u2019s love and freedom. And to have no control over it. Yet it seems that she is the angrier one between us, drama-ing around uncontrolably, ending our day's talks and revelations into the SERIOUS thinking that everything is nice haha, we learn, we laugh, but now THIS IS SERIOUS. Of course, the risen dukkha is not coming from Real World Consequences and One\u2019s control over them. The Mind\u2019s pondering, then, it is no longer the pondering of an extraordinary machine. But it becomes the pondering of a emotion-full Mind, blinded by the underlying experiences about an \u201cI\u201d and the \u201ccountry of an \u201cI\u201d\u201d - suffering, not being recognized, being forced to Nothing - and so on.

His view is extraordinarily alligned with the Dellusions of \"I\" and thinking it has such great control, While in fact is nothing but a ramifications of deep genetics, life story and envinronment. Yes - could be so - but that would still be, just as his concepts, a nihilism way of viewing things and the ignorance of the true magic of God inside the body and world. Therefore, just as we wrote before, there is no Free will until one truly Awakens to the senses, conditionins and neural activations. Once there is light upon the continous aliveness and conditionings, about the Laws of Nature - One can begin to Choose. Yet keep close to heart the \"Letters of the Past\" - which is the symbol of full realization and integration of the genetic memory branch echo-ing from father, mother, ancestors. \"When i write, you Write.\" \"When i laugh, you Laugh.\" The man with the gun scenario, pulling the trigger, becomes a full awakening to all the data flowing from inner and outer senses. Then it remains the Choice - which Role to Play. It seems that the alchemy of the KS2 reaches a low point after meal is finished digesting in first phase. As food moves onto the second phase, \"empty\" acidicity is left on the stomach. In this magial window, only if it is met by faith, water, movement - can the stomach truly empty and relax. This will have to be caressed for in KS2 Model. For KS2 Model, we have to continously pass in the time of day and stomach fullness. Deeper, stomach fullness must consider: time of day.

The very alchemy of energy & smell he leaves in the Dojo is causing dukkha to arise. More so, on a deeper level, the way his body continously reacts to inside fears of fails and weakness, swallowing, in bio-mechanical fails, and so on - further confirming, once again very clearly - that body flaws in movement spring from sickened Mind patterns, which are almost always unconciousness for the Mind. In great suffering, a Mind cannot stop. The Mind is not actually afraid of boredom then, so terrified in remaining blank and alone - but it is afraid from the sufferings which awaits. I understand my friend, for i know all the flavors of the sicknesses upon him - yet i cannot help and it is affecting me too. The disorder & dirty habits, being lazy up to the utmost point of wanting what i want to buy and get - only to not fall into putting energy in thinking and afraid of what patterns might await there. He is a truly strong mind tho, aware of all of this, breathing hard and heavy as he expresses how the vices rule his life. But of course, at the center of his soul there are complete shakles now. No Freedom, full entrampment of the soul, body and MInd. The greatest suffering it may be. Yes, this is his way of coping with it, but he is making steps everyday. At his own pace. His path should not be burdened by one's path, but reflected only compared to past moments. I enjoy my friend, but the pollution of the alchemy cannot be ignored. So just a few days it's enough.

Eate half cake, trying sugar effect, and some sips of panemar sandwich. Panemar sandwich clear dukkha, as already known for years - but with faith and water - stomach seems to recover in ~1 hour.

KS2 calms down, different from yesterday - in which day it was kept in a loop of food + trigger. 6pm - serving of last meal - rice with coconut and bananas - (now this could have been a flaw, the bananas mixed with stuff in the night?) Completely stop eating - but as i lay down and prepare sleep 2-3 hours later - i can feel the acid going up.. predicting a hard night. I think should have taken refalcid or other medications at this point, right where prediction was clear - but i rather fall into perfectionism - forcing sleep in hopes of healing itself with only water and no food. Wake-up on chair about 1 hour later, with accentuated feeling - water and sleep. Well, you know when the body is calling the Mind back to Rise - the worst thing to do is to force more sleep. Force another sleep ~2-3 hours - now awakened at 1 it's much worse - clearly the little sensible stomach was not prepared for this pattern of stopping food at 6pm in this alchemy and forcing to sleep towards a horizontal-like position. Take half stomach-acid medicine and eate 2 pretzels with yoghurt - calming not calming - i don't know - it seems to remain un-changed. Watch TV series and lay down - now the mind is not only reading some feelings in the stomach - as it did for hundreds of times and nights where i rose and simply respected the body's need to not lay down - but to clean, learn, study - allowing the stomach to do it's job of calming down naturally. But no, now the mind is taking these readings and turning them into fears of great diseases and sufferings, while crawling back to sleep - thinking if it doesn't go back to sleep fast the immune system will go down and on and on.. and on. Of course, the mind is also in sick patterns and are preventing it from going outside in the cold.. or squatting down in fresh air.. or other blessings which normally would calm the Stomach down. Stopping smoking didn't seem to have much effect in the night. ~Feeling like a feather when going up the stairs - not felt this in a looong time. Good morning from the balcony, my friend. No Spinu this morning - yet come out and create and immerse into all other dhammas as if Spinu was here. The position, the clean air.. the writing, reflections. That is the true Art of falling out of love with Spinu and food - not to isolate in self-torment like breath has been taken away.. but to continue your purpose here on earth. Just as many years ago on chronic smoking - do all the things you'd normally crave Spinu for. You will learn that they are amazing and the beauty was in them, all along - not Spinu.

Immediately begin anti-biotics. If negative-negative, you've lost 130 ron. If positive-negative, ~The Alchemy of the Body speaking. Then no energy would have been consumed in suffering-inducing patterns. All scenarios are covered in wisdom, beyond fearful patterns of the Mind. ~ And beyond papers and complicated words alchemized in the Mind, truly read the input of the body. Lovingly guide the beast towards the Blessed Path. In this realm, the holy Beast seems to greatly be healing, getting better and better every week. LE: of course, if God has it that targeted PP area and symptoms get worse, consider checking Monday morning and starting anti-biotics."}

Well, as mother said some while ago about my ponderings \"I Have full trust in you that you will find a way to do it.\" Big feast in the morning, as a response to arising sufferings of the body, work stress, some degree of sloth. Blessed fruits bowl followed little later by big chips and 2x yoghurts. Now the beast is really fed. But of course, this is no easy thing for the stomach. Echoes of chips and yoghurts (1 chocolate) are felt, but they also give great energy. We start working and alternating cleaning and ordering with work.

The croissant with milk \"I\" was already clinging to birth. A full stop after soup would have been dhamma.

Starts eating pear and cooking warm grains with fruits - then immerses in work high-level purpose. Amazingly healing. Little sips of food with medium sips of true work in Dedication and Sincere effort. Slowly, the system completely calms down. In wisdom, it hasn't drank any water in the last 5 hours as morning approaches and long-exposure time pee pee is needed for test. The body hasn't required it tho, and nor the PP. ~Second-wake up comes after 2 more hours, again the body is calling the Mind back to conciousness, As the very acidic stomach envinronment (un-dilluted by food for last 33+ hours and by water for the last 8+), rises up the tract and burns. Fully Rise but the damage it seems to great - the high temperature, too night & cold to go outside. A wave of feeling very weakened, which felt like a controlled, self-induced acidic and recovering envinronment - here it was felt that just as the body weakens and dies to rebirth, so do the micro-organisms and bacterias living inside. ~Oh what a night followed. First wake-up after ~4 hours - awaken with mild Stomach sensations after laying to sleep perfectly flat (could have chosen incline or take stomach pill when night felt acidic.) Rise for little while but not fully - the Mind was clinging to a later wake-up. Half-Rise with blanket. ---Full Rest horizontal lay down: I'm only here to watch, my friend--- The Mind fully disconnects from the Outerworld and any \"I\" and returns inside to just watching all the body sensations. Yet it does not want to change anything here, it just watches fascinated. True Rest... Sometimes it goes into higher level pattern analysis, allowing the body to do it's job. One of the system's favorite activities. System feels so calm.. yet KS.PP is still so much reacting to G-Force when the Mind focuses on it. With the Mind in High-er level purpose and somewhat out of X pattern, it dissipates. A plan for tonight comes to me, so natural and instinctual - like from God. Have a hot bath little later - nourish the system with water and slow down water consumption as the evening approaches - reaching None 2 hours before sleep. This will allow concentrated pee-pee in the morning. Go straight at 7-8 am to re-test. Use the last money for paying. Then begin your day. Money slowly finishes on cards and left with 100 cash. Tomorrow salary day. We almost did hold, my friend - isn't it amazing? We gave way to all Natural Heart's desires - and yet still we hold. The Magic of simple food and micro-dosing, just as teached in Re-Connect, only 50% will change One's Life. ---Fasting: The Cross-Road--- Warm coffee 2 pm on the balcony. To keep Fast or to eat? As system relaxes, the wave of hunger & fear-induced eating fades away. It has been truly long since we fasted, my friend. And we never did in this alchemy, only in really high emotional peaks. If there is one \"regret\" i sometimes ponder about our KS2, it is being so difficult to fast. One day of eating shall not heal anything, believe me. For now, we keep going. Let's meet another wave of \"The beast hungry, but we do not eat.\" See how KS.PP develops. ~ Relaxing of deep legs and pelvic muscles. ---KS.PP assessment without food--- It has triggered in the morning after ~1h up time enclosed standing in house.

Had fun with ciu. 11pm comes. Hunger() rises. Stomach empties and needs water and belief. In a short walk to the kitchen, there is this pattern analysis of the mind that 1-2 little pain au laits would actually help - in a way that the stomach is now empty and just little, little bit would help. In other words, a form of disbelief. So, the \"I\" births. Eat 2 jabba jabba with 1 glass of milk, but the neurons already fire. Now, this process can be seen and another activation network can happen - bound to trust, or discipline (as pelicanu) or many other ways. Finish with ice cream. Sleep immediately follows. Of course, heavy - after milk, pain au laits and ice cream. But still only a water wake around 3. Rested, but affected. However, there is great progress in the evening, my friend.

Also paired with pee pee triggered from wind+cold+purifier - creating Current. This was clearly the X moment.

It's cold, but the wool blanket is doing it's job keeping perfectly warm. Good morning, my sweet body. You know i tried all my heart - the eating and everything we did was with the pure intent of aiding. KS.PP and coconuts felt much more amazing yesterday. Even back became painless towards evening. Its cold, but the Mind has done it's job of protecting. Smile. The virus entered through community (skinny attacks and others from hairdressers, food attacks&others from granny, etc) - and they were further alchemized by the Mind reading inputs - as mirror reflection, acidicity state. It is such a clear connection between ~feelings rising from outer world contact and stomach - Just as in fights with Ammy, being attacked by mom,granny, others - instantly alchemizes the stomach into acidicity. Beyond the matters of community, the Yardi project pressure was there throughout the day. Lets dive into it today. The cockaroo is singing the beginning of a new day.

{"prompt": "Transform your pain into wisdom and healing.", "content": "---School Alchimizes from Hell to Heaven--- Studying... then kneeling and studying more. Well one thing is clear. I do not fear school anymore. The idea of \"Hell\" which the Mind painted from childhood as being a deep state of suffering and entrapment of freedom - has been alchimized to Heaven. It was not school, but stained teachers, system, humans.. And in the un-being - there are no Humans. Some inflamation persists around the area with some feeling of inflamation towards the right kidney. (where the herniated disks sit, which might have been triggered by first night of antibiotics effect.) Pee pee again no noticeable blood this time. And poo poo. Feel too sick to get out of house. Makes me ponder the weigh of Natural Truths - as they seem to bend in front of Infections - as a new, foreign \"entity \" trying to reproduce and survive. Eat on the body. Can the System get rid of it? In a game of survival, the question is clear. And the great lesson to immediately seek wisdom in the medical world - especially in this type of scenario (having sex after long break with immediate body response). First cycle of sleep on the chair - waking up in ~ 2 hours very sweaty. Change and move to Dojo's bed with Ammy. Another sleep quickly follow ~3-4 hours until 3.28am. Drink water and pee pee - some acidic and little less drops of blood at the end. The feeling are going more towards the urethra, especially towards the tip. Story of a brother on youtube recovering beyond expectations: \"The human body is a miracle of nature fr. Never lose hope!!\" Eate my potato soup and taken antibiotic. All feels good - Dukkha slowly starts to cultivate from CQ legendary coat. Eat some little walnuts and cereals after around 8pm. In the last 6 hours body has been digesting continously and night is closing. The pee pee interval has greatly reduced to normal and no blood. Go out for a ride.. Although body is very tired. Drink water. Pee pee feelings starts to change from itchy as this afternoon to stingyness. Very dukkha mental patterns arise with ammy as we \"talk\" about her stay here, cooking, etc - all leading to suffering in this state. Many fears are born of fatigue.. it is clearly playing a part in this alchemy of the Mind. Sampajana at this moment would mean to completely disregard pattern analysis on future plans & prediction about her Mind (not being developed, deep auto-pilot, etc. ). This is not a time for that, my dear friend. But for now this is a time for Healing, followed by the era of Neo. Then.. we shall see about this. - But in this alchemy and hers too, this is not happening. The Mind is running pattern analysis on this dukkhas and the waves deeply felt in the stomach. Waves after waves. But it didn't - felt like from both body and Mind \"i\" was throwing guilt at my sweet Ammy. She is heartbroken - her Mind analyzes patterns - no matter how bended - just to liberate her guilt of possibly making her son sick. Much, much suffering. Get home, fighted urge to pee pee for a little while then went. Very yellow and acidic - with some drops of mixed blood at the end. Take plant bath. Good night."}

{"prompt": "Imagine a world where snacks bring comfort and chaos.", "content": "~The Second Encounter with Chips 9pm. Now the chips taste goood, or at least not good - but they are offering a distraction and pleasure for the Mind, And for the body they offer a slow pushing-down of food and risen acid on the upper tract. A very short benefit for both Mind & Beast. It is why eating them with yoghurt is so comforting - because the yoghurt is cold and cools down the tract, but again it is a very very temporary relief. Eating chips without anything cold reveals their true alchemy, so acidic, so heavy, so stained.. The Mind sees this, but in this alchemy it cannot recollect enough knowledge. Of course, the Body's energy levels also are solving the equation of energy in<>energy out and requesting Food, as it has been little food today. Stop at half chips, but the state which the mind & beast wanted to fix - is now more heavy than before, haha. So continues after a little while to eat the rest of chips, this time with cold rice&yoghurt. Oh the cold rice&yoghurt is so comforting in the moment. But the System had now filled with food to digest for the next few hours. Sleep comes soon."}

A strong, tall man, is now walking the same path and lower temperature than what just weeks before felt like a injured, weak beast. Perhaps the Call of the Beast's sexual energy is not to masturbate, but to feel again a woman's energy. Oh, the world of Game - even wider than the job search. How, why, what exactly did the Mind do towards all this? To heal like this? Nothing. Nothing but respecting somewhat more the Natural truths so they don't interfere with the Body's mystical and magical touch. The low-level extraordinary work of the body when trusted. God's' Hand. And it's in God's Hands. Just like One's work, relationships, purpose. Abide the Natural laws and they shall take you where you need to go."}
{"prompt": "Imagine the perfect meal to nourish both body and mind.", "content": "One thing is clear. To truly asses and contemplate smoking, One MUST walk the day with a clean, dhamma filled stomach. And an empty one as evening falls down. Then you will SEE. If smoking is quitted but at the price of dukkha uncontrolable rising of food, then it is a much serious and immediately problem for the body. The acidic un-sleep-able states and giving into the great excess - for sure must be cutting out, if kept like this and worse, more years of life span than smoking 2-3 a day. So once again, back to school. Back to food. It is a true Art. I know now it is not about eating boiled vegetables 3 times a day, but rather a very intimate and complicated dance. The Violin and Violonist."}

Outside with coffee and Spinu. Despite stomach misfortune last 2 days, the system seems to be astronomically better regarding cold and back-pain sensibility. And even though hurting the KS2, it was not about excess, gluttony or pleasure. Just a Mind trying to feed a beast. Failing together. Learning together. Ad astra, my friend. ~Last time i began the day at this hour and alchemy, the system was completely free of disease and viruses. What a beautiful alchemy to experience once again, when just weeks ago i never could have imagined it. 14 hours later, and the beast is still burping traces of the burger. Oh my little powerful beast. Huge poo poo, again taking out the fermenting waste. Feels so liberating. The low alchemy continued in sleep - first dreaming of some last moment with Ammy before we have to part. Very heavy on the heart - when the Mind and Beast cannot fix some \"core problems\". Next and wake-up dream was of a beautiful feeling - the un-speakable realisation of \"There is no I.\" It felt so clear, so peaceful. Nothing is mine, there is only this experience of Life happening by itself. Moving by itself. Working by itself. Eating by itself. The Mind guiding, not holding on. Soon it's 1am and the body has had some ~6 hours to sleep and the time for sleep has ended for now, as the stomach asks to Rise. Very very bad effect of burger. Continued to study hugging face & LLMs & setting up envinronment. Succesfully loaded whisper large turbo v3 locally using both data set (pipeline) integration and local file read. Splitted into audio-chunks. It transcribes truly beautiful. Then onto research & debugging of Aria in the light of learning LLMs env. preparation. A high acidic state persisted following the burger, just as when we were a child, the same burning nuance. Also the research and working itself was kinda stressfull, as so much unknown and overwhelming - questioning as the alchemy drops if we are not disrespecting the Sabbath."}

{"prompt": "Explore the balance between mind and body in your evening rituals.", "content": "---The Clean dhamma food house--- Build your dhamma food knowledge. Then build your house. Wake up at 12:30 from a troubled dream. KS2 is affected 3 and 10. But its cold.. I'm tired.. no energy to rise. I lay down at the computer, covered and reclined. Oh and it slowly builds.Acid flows up. KS2 dukkha starts rising 3,4,5,6,7.. I give short water-rises and cleaning - but too tired to do much - too cold. When I rise it calms down ~1 point, but as I return to laying down it goes back. And more and more the fight for rise or sleep. I'm so sorry my sweet body - i do love you so much and i need your help to overcome this. Cold outside, closing windows. Dukkha closed air added to combination. Lay down at tv series - the stomach still feels very full, bloated more on the lower part. A stress state also had surrounded the body, with the mind always focused on the KS2 sickness and all implications. Inner deep muscles and fascial lines tensioning. Breath is affected.Organs feel heavy, acidic. If there is a trade-off between food and smoking to be made at night, it's a clear choice for now. Use smoking if u have to, but at any cost - allow KS2 to shut down at evening. At any cost - there is nothing more important than this - no project, no relationship, no dhamma. The highest priority - allow KS2 to shut down at evening. If this is happening, you are spinning the wheel more than you could ever spin it in other projects. The Body&Mind needs to enter the calming, clear mind evening state with a nourished body. It is the only way to remain into it, in the changing alchemies of Hunger, tiredness, more hunger. With food excess and dukkha, the whole evening alchemy goes way down. Could not even listen to Sadghuru while DotA-ing. Of course - the woman's love, Ammy, body needs, mind needs - everything needs a woman's touch, love and baby. The core disturbance (The Rachita's old house haha). \"The adapting\" great life skills just uncovered of course, unable to manifest. The \"I\"s eating were already born and clinged. As they lived, more \"I\"s was born. This is why it's tricky - to stop eating - to not give into excess. The mind recognizes a dangerous faulty pattern. It thinks it can control it, it thinks it can full stop after bread and avocado (aka last bite), that is it think that it can control the \"I\" wanting to eat. But how? Because as soon as it allows it to be born, the birth has completely happened. The \"I\" who has imagined heaven picture from Upload as a continuous eating - a VR in which one would eat continuously. How boring would that be, how tiring :))). But as soon as it births, it doesn't want to die anymore. This \"I\" does not know how to fall in and out of love - with life. It trembles in the face of death. At any sign of disease, sickness, it trembles. Many other \"I\", patterns of the mind have complete trust in my ancestors, in this body, in this Body & Mind destiny and part in this world. So much more beyond food - which is a but a fuel - but a few \"shots\" during one's dhamma work. So then, the mind is forced to surrender or kill the \"I\". But the mind loves itself completely and has given full freedom for the patterns to execute. So it's very hard to rise and KILL this over-taking \"I\". As soon as it eats, it grows stronger. The instinct of survival. EATING. Imagine how much pain, death, suffering, fighting, separations, joys, extasies - this act carries. How much killing was done by this genetic memory of millions of years in eating. So then? Well most of the nights - the mind prepares for battle, consumes resources in great pattern analysis and worry - just to have it all clash in it's face like a YoYo. The secret of KS2 healing is to meet the evening hunger with whatever it may bring as just another alchemy, with the same faith in God. Same feeling of Destiny, of the Play, of the Drama, of the inter-connected systems. This was discovered just recently - maybe i had 1 day in thailand (the coconut mango rice smoke nok hook). The Complete Faith - embrace hunger. drink water. breath fresh air. Expand. Then do your dhamma work. Write. Before this, the Mind had only managed to KILL the Eater in a few nights, with great resources consumption - meaning complete stop of eating in great pain (emotional, physical). In 99% of the nights, it has been a battle. But in the last month, as i returned to school - an effortless way arose. (only experiences this in high peaks with women before or in return to CQ) - The Humble Monk. Eat little to no food - and if truly need to eat - grab a bite - just like a car returning home, needing perhaps just a few litres of gas to reach home, where new, fresh, good fuel awaits in the next day. For this, the Eater must learn, in the evening alchemy of low chi, hunger, M* or not, to fall in and out of love. To use food as fuel. \"Nobody shall die tonight\" - can ONLY happen if the Eater willingly and gracefully lets go. ~The Body slowly Recovers~ ----The Mind Fighting itself---- Kaya Sankhara2 Evening crossroads. Dhamma paths: The Eater falling in and out of Love, allowing the Body&Mind to do it's dhamma work here on earth. There is no Battle. It births, eats in calmness and peace, then dies. (7-10 Sleep, 1-3 KS2 dukkha) The Mind puts the Eater to sleep - like a loving owner putting an animal to sleep to not hurt himself. The werewolf tying itself in chains out of love, not to hurt itself when the Beast births. This can happen only by faith. Trust in Water. (6-8 Sleep, 2-4 KS2 dukkha) Dukkha paths: The Fight - on a scale from 0 - no resistance from the mind to 10 - great battle of instincts, mind, patterns, sufferings. The Eater kills the Mind - the mind & body and numbed and surrendered to the eater - completely giving in to foods in great, great excess - The purpose of life becomes eat-vain activity to allow little digestion-eat more - until it gets bored or the system becomes too sick. (1-3 sleep follows, 6-9 KS2 dukkha) The draw - casualties on both sides but ground is defended. (6-7 and 10 sleep, 2-3 KS2 dukkha) The Mind kills the Eater - complete forcedown of the Eater (4-6 and 10 sleep, 3-5 KS2 dukkha) The = is both the battle, battlefield and fighters. It is defined by genetics activated in certain environments - fueled by Karmic Balance. The patterns are very clear defined. Now, for the healing to happen, it's clear that paths 1&2 need to be walked. At least 50%, my friend. Of course, this = 's core needs of family, love, community, purpose - are yet unfulfilled - but the wheels are spinning. Only the Eater fears them all. The Healer has no need for dukkha food in his house, supporting and falling to the sickness caused by the modern food industry. But the house is filled with fruits, grains, vegetables, nuts, seeds. If he likes croissants, he will bake them. Milk.. its good in coffee. The Eater will have short bursts of births & deaths while in stores - but also it must be brought to light the great energy it brings - similar to sexual. Amazing, amazing chi generating being. But could the Mind generate such energy without falling victim to it? Fully allow the \"I\" to birth and bring it's chi, only to have the Mind rise and lovingly put the \"I\" back to sleep,, harvesting it's energy. Just imagine.. what One could do with such energy - in a Body & Mind functionality close to 100%. The Alchemist. Begin the eating - Avocado cream cheese bread - always a trigger - the white flour IS extremely triggering. (white flour + diary) Instant followed by yoghurt with peanut oat ba and more bread + milk cream. (diary + peanuts + oats&other bar shit + sugar and more processed milk) Dukkha regarding work and Ammy rises (money, visa, feeling cold). Rest for 1-2 hours.. then eat again. Chips + yoghurt + corn puffs (diary + processed oils and foods) Milk + chocolate oat bar and wafers (milk + chocolate from bar + palm oil + more processed things) Very full and bloated. Pick up my pen and paper and write, finish GPT video - what a calming activity. Body & mind at full content. Play a dota, mind loses focus of it for a while. Finish with a little chocolate. A lot.. a lot of food inside. A lot. Dukkha regarding everything rises but not too obvious - more like hidden - slowly growing more and more. Seeing videos of past physical form, Ammy visa, money, re-connect, purpose.. I check every 2 minutes for a tiktok spike - just to take the mind off this dukkha alchemy. Sleep comes around 9pm. - Go to sleep. All in all.. how much dukkha food man, and how much excess. How hidden. Maan.. 3-4 hours work for little CPR. A"}

It's only first day. Learn. Adapt. Become better. A good internet cable and music while streaming would be a lovely first step. Add documents for the Fuckboy. Ready to win, ready to lose.

Fallback to previous data - the eating of granny cake with milk - similar portion to yesterday - oh but the other alchemies was far from it. Differently, there was great great tiredness of the system. Fall asleep again and wake up 2AM - as emotional turmoil continues with the Killing pattern and the G-Force X pattern on stomach - and with tiredness - and with enclosed air - giving way to a ideal fermenting envinronment. ~The emotional turmoils follows: Feeling overwhelmed by food_prophet, some PonPon suffering as she had not come online at all this day. Maybe i should have messaged her, but there is a force, a feeling of wrath maybe, as she is clearly holding back from talking. That is to say, there is clearly an \"I\" wanting to birth in her as talking and another \"I\" killing it due to fear. Of course, if her \"I\" does not birth, neither does ours. Somehow this affects the system into fueling it, wrathing it. The emotional turmoil meets G-Force in reclined position due to tiredness. Short fall asleep and wake up due to the great ~Killing going on inside. Trickster activates in this low env and prones the system to another meal for calming. It does so. Now everything is so heavy, from the beginning to the end of Digestive Trackt. So clearly digestion is slowed down up to 0.5 peak in complete rest and fermentation. ~But also so tired... sleep regardless of heavy-ness until 8 AM - a long sleep all in all.

{"prompt": "Explore the hidden connections between body, mind, and the universe.", "content": "\"Ah.. what can i say - but the deep intrisicate dance of Alkaline-Acidic? Guiding the life of all bacteria and enzymes inside. Air one breath, is once again, the pillar of it. The fuel for all the things living inside. I can clearly feel it. The effect of clean, deep, expansive breathing. The focus of the Mind on body signals. The processing of these signals and giving way to more feelings. Let the Mind do it's bidding - whatever it is, let it perform some tasks succefully. Let it read the world, analyze and perform. Learn. Adapt. Then one will be perfectly alligned with the Tao. In that potato, in that click. HIgher plans are merely things of wordlings - like Kings, Wars and social positions. And the world, it is not on your shoulders to change. But to Touch. And when it's time to part, bow down to everything the Mind has experienced and lived together with the body. Look at the great and little people around, each with it's purpose - and wish them good luck in future endeavors, alone and in unity. ~Still, through feeling there remains the universal language of the universe: love. High frequency. Body & Mind alligned with the Tao. Joy of Life. Falling in love.~ ~And, the dualities~ ~And, syncronicithies~ ~And.. Omens~ These are things beyond the body & Mind. Purely felt. And they all points to the absolute magic of Life. Read the world. Move when it's time to move, Eat when it's time to eat, Rest when it's time to rest, Write when it's time to Write. All sufferings arise from the mind & body drifting away from these Natural Truths. Influeced by external factors (Like office job, outside temperature and pollution) and internal factors (mind falling into dukkha, clouded, unable to find dhammas of Falling in and Out of Love with Life.) Study what prevents One from doing it and Bind the Matter with true dedication and effort. Then everything will allign. I think the question of the universe ponders upon if the history of it is real, or is it a simulation? If the history is real - then the body and mind are merely oa part of it all. The whole history of the universe is right here, in this Body & Mind. And death is, as all things, just a part of it all. If everything is a simulation, then the history may not be real, but merely programmed. - and it is the only scenario in which someone evaluates the \"Mind&Body\". But again, this body is given by ancestors or the program. And it is utterly and directly affecting the Mind. Would it be reasonable then, to asses the Mind alone? Perhaps assess how good it can drive it, and perhaps evaluated towards some goals. And later use the data it has gathered for some higher purposes. If not developed towards the goal, disregard \"It\". But the body instantly reacts with some echoes springing from Fear of Suffering & Death. Well, if that is the case, my friend, it is not the body which will suffer. Nor the Mind. For the Mind cannot be alive without the body. It is together. When One's journey ends, another one ends as well. Anyhow, regardless of what is there, the Legend still remains to play One's part here on Earth. In the CQ world, in a touch, a smile, everything which feels dhamma for the body. Let it guide you. But if you were to program this world and users (a deeper layer of Mind beyond reading world data) - what would you seek? And would you seek something? Or would it be just purely for entertainment? The Hindu's say it's purely for entertainment. It feels so. In a child, an animal, a fly, a sun set and sun down - nothing seems to come with a pressure to do anything but.. experience. All flavors. There is no pressure, all are merely wordly things - this is what the body feels as it absorbs nature. This would be the answer which answers All. The \"Simulation\" train thought has a fatal flaw. That is it keeps going in simulations. Let's say we simulate and find out the secrets of the universe. - that would be the purpose if it is a simulation. It would not be to find the cure for X or some technology. But it would be to find the secrets of the universe itself. If you can get a simulation running up to a point where it simulates another world, then in a matter of seconds, you would reach the secrets of the universe. But that still might not answer the question of the Game. Yes, you'd find all the game secrets and cheats. But you're still in a Game. So why not enjoy? All flavors, all study, all fails, know but also enjoy this world truly. So you see, my friend - the Tao answers the question. And to live by the Tao is to live the right life. To live with pressure regarding a simulation and survival of the program (Mind) - is foolish. For one, it would immediately deffer one from his path - and 2 - the simulation will just keep going. Let there be a choosing then, toward life and death itself. Let there be known by the Mind that it is fueled by life by this body, and this body by the Tao. Let it deeply study the Alchemies of this world. Bind with them. Fall in love with this world. And when it's time, out of love. Play your part here on earth. The potato. The smile. The click on the screen. Let go of control.\""}

No matter how sleepy the body is, if it will fall to inclined sleep now, things will be much worse. Waking up, with some manipulation of light and just doing it, becomes healing.

We've tasted so much suffering and wisdom from suffering, perhaps it's time we taste the other side of the spectrum? And study what goes wrong. First step: clean the Dojo food. Prepare the Dojo variety food for the day. The Key moments are moments of suffering arising from senses - processed in the mind - and outputting a body + Mind response in faulty eating, despite clear statistical data. Only a Mind which rises above the illusions of \"I\"s can prevail. And Only a Mind completely filled with Faith can do so. The clear statistical data points to 2 dhamma approaches, depending on the alchemy and present: Full stop around 3-4-5 - sacred ritual of water-move-water-teeth-water- prepare for sleep. Or having little sips of food. The night Karmic Balance, preparing for my morning brother. But know this. Suffering will arise. And it will be up strictly on how you meet it. Can One meet it with complete and Absolute faith? With Faith, the Mind will become Void, the soul full - and the dhamma path will reveal. If not, the soul will become empty, the Mind full of fears and the Body full of food - and the dukkha path will reveal. Good morning, my friend. The cross stands upright.

Slowly, Falling in and out of love with any dhamma arises. The Holy 7 days are not about not eating at all at evening, or fasting, or constant little meals, althought they fulfill them in a way. Looked at with fixed plans and patterns, it is un-computable and un-do-able, as the body and all envinronmnetal dhammas are in continous change. But the 7 days begin to shape in a more clearer way if looked at Maintaining a constant medium-high Karmic Balance on Kaya Sankhara2. This considers all things - from food quantity, quality, timing, logistics, feelings, all contacts with the Outside world, Movement That encompasses them all. When KS2 starts to be over 0.5, all other conditioners and system begin healing, performing, prottected by the Immune system.

Out on the balcony, i really don't want to get back to Spinu's cousin. It's sickening the system. Clearly. KS. I bow down to N for hosting. Go in Peace in your way, my friend. I bow down to the night unfolding. To God. Take the lessons.. and continue your Journey. ~Riding in the Golden Hour~ Absolutely perfect time. Vortex is taken care of. As high socks take care of wind. Everything is covered. The system is singing. Tiring, but beautiful Ride. Waiting for the sun to set more.. Vacaru handling of his girlfriend call. So fucking unapologetic. Amazing character. Patience from Zhou. It was clear more waiting is the right decision. The only question is can One find something free of dukkha to do while the Sun naturally sets? Find your dhamma way. Vacaru talk. Ice cream. Move to Park. Watching the scooter and people.. Final walk in park before Go. The park.. this is also a huge dhamma to consider. If Ludus Home (N crib) was in Dacia, it would not have completed the circle. ---Inside the Mind of a Gambler--- So similar to this Mind when eating. A dukkha smell persists in the air.. Clothes finishing up, Spinu finishing up, Dhamma work tomorrow.. time to go Home. The evening ride. Sun is slowly setting. ---Exactly same input-output in dhamma envinronment--- Food excess instantly followed by walk around the city. Big Meal followed by Big Walk. Breath. Community. How can i Find this somewhere else? Air, my friend. Then Logistics. Then Community. You Eate big - now Walk big. Full strides. Breath. Ankles. Of course, only if the environment allows. The VR experience. It has, finally became playable after a decade. Smooth enough to imitate reality. Stomach dizziness and brain reacting. Then adapting. Oh but the flow. The angles are perfect. But still, Air greatly prevails. As N smokes and room becomes smoky & bad, pleasure of game is lost. What if i rent it 1 week from him? Working on Re-Connect & Cleaning Around & Preparing cook. Integrating Task & Journey of the Pilgrim. Set the blueprints for One's personal legend. Everything changes as sexual chakra and purpose gets again activated, just being in the proximity - in the possibility of the approached woman, As she follows me back on tiktok. What a Master man. Speaking his truth. A true shame not to experience it more. The womens in Ren are such beautiful creatures. The Mind of a Woman. Even if nothing happens, just the play of it its ecstatic. ----1 Mai Sunday Church---- \u201cRuga mea-i tacerea. \u201c People singing beautifully. Still, in the new Age Ludus, more and more being apprehended by the touch of modern man industrialization, there is still pureness. The Sun is completely \"Unforgiving\", with a clear blue sky. Contemplating leaving, but have some patience. Find purpose - and you will find Meaning. No matter how small or big. Just as in Bangkok empty night. Maybe Flo. Mihaela. Nasu house. Rid around, walk around. Respect nature. Seeking the shadows. Sexual energy over-coming everything, as the hot tattoo'ed girl gets in front of prioritization. Hesitated. Then came back. Just walk into the store. ~Nicoleta. She is completely engaged. Huge 38 years assumption spike :)). She is so similar to Anna fit mom, to Ammy - such familiar patterns. Crazy. Life is here. And it is just a heartbeat.. away. Women.. is no easy thing. Allow natural unfolding. Bought some egg cheese tortillas. Let's see. In just 30 seconds i learn how to do it. For now.. Sun is too powerful for anything else. Eat. Watch TV Series."}
{"prompt": "Explore the relationship between love and food in your life.", "content": "The great difference in the week of the Soul regarding food - was humbleness and little meals, my friend. As little as 3-4 sips of Food. Many times. Falling in and out of Love with food continuously - this is the path to Heal. And if some high-medium activity rises, have medium-big meal before. If I were to draw the blueprints of yesterday - half cake + immediate quarter highly triggering focacia + pesto + raw smoked meat. Acidicity calmed down in Working Mind and position - but soon returns as I lay down and all food finishes, only acid remaining. Pair this with last meal of half banana and coconut - which again from experience can be very triggering. Then laying down and when body is asking to rise, rise little bit and lay down again. A clear recipe for disaster in a previously sensible stomach. Take reflacid eventually and some comfort food but it's too late - there is too much acidicity. The esophagus is already damaged and open. I'm so sorry, my love. Let me try again. Let's try again together. 3-4 sips of simple, simple food spread across the day as the sun is up on the sky. Remaining strictly in the present - any pattern analysis driven out of fear of death and unknown, meet them at the door. I know it is a truly hard thing to do. But you cannot understand the core level of life, Mind. The functioning of the body, digestion, immunity, Heart, Life, God. You can only Feel and Believe."}

In this alchemy, this sum of dhammas had broken the mind. Completely give into food and fears. This was paired with a physical extortion days and little rest - snowballing into the lack of power to Rise at first wake-up. Have you forgotten, my friend? The first wake-up. It must be deeply honoured - the body signal to Rise. It is not the Mind's signal. Learnt about Garret's esophagus - nothing new - just a normal consequence and adaptation on long-term inflammation paired with many other factors. Dreamt about aloneness and lack of community - and later with Ammy fucking some black man. 7.30pm. Back on the balcony. There was a choice: between no smoking and eating - and smoking and not eating (let's see later). And so, final reflections of the great holiday. I really don't know what to do with Ammy's visa. An 'I' wants it, another doesn't. The One who doesn't see's it just as another holiday, another play - which he'd rather not partake in the expense of money, energy. Can One stay focused on his path? Well of course. All in all, cheers, my friend. Great holiday. Great steps forward. Huge KS2 trigger post smoking, beginning to m* - started to be veeery bloated. Mind wants to escape to food. Eate baked potatoes - extremely triggered reaction follows. Go to granny, mind defocuses, ks2 slowly relaxes. Very possible the smoking in this alchemy + m* - to be 2 huge signals to start secreting gastric acid. Of course, gravity must be also considered, for it all flew upwards - but it was not instantly met by calming food as usual. I enter Phase 5: B. The Humble Monk. Perhaps some dhamma food today consisting of simple, well-cooked ingredients. Potatoes, Rice, Avocado. Relax, my sweet Kaya Sankhara 2. I love you all my heart. 1.30pm. Back home. Dhamma working on car, cleaning it in greatness by my own hand. A tesla parks behind me and wash. I look at it with complete gratitude in the Tao - for i would choose in any day of the week a Tesla Body and a Ford than a Tesla and a Ford body. Using the sexual energy generated by Cool Amy to do One's dhamma work. A true Alchemist. All in all, the holiday was absolutely amazing. Car - deployed, cleaned, dhamma steps in identifying issues Scooter - decided to repair and take out alarm - at dad mechanic Re-Connect - Filmed with my brother. Post-filming- in the quietness of editing, i see he speaks great things. Wouldn't have hade it with any other dude. G. Lucas - amazing post filming editing, completely saving the day. ReConnect_Breathing - Done <3. Extraordinarily beautiful, my friend. Learn Agriculture - Granny teachings. Day together with granny and mommy. Good morning, my friend. Another day is here. Slept 2 hours from 5 to 7, reflecting on newly learnt mechanisms. So.. the holiday ends with forwards steps in Car&Scooter. In the night I had prepared time loggin and starting the work day.\""}

Surprisingly, even with such bad beans, crosisant, milk, bread, full chocolate, milk again - a pretty good sleep followed. Slept until 7am with a journey from moderate flavors of dukkha-dhamma path. ~But how could i ever find an environment like this at Home? First thing- Air - is already stained in Cluj. Nothing else can follow. This is a lifetime search, just as written before. Ahh.. the Walking.. Once the air and environment allows, the walking is magical. Better than gym. I\u2019ve missed this. Such clean air. People walking around without smoking. Free the ankles. A long forgotten feeling. It needs dhamma environment. Staredown with waitress. The Art of Packing & Preparing. In calmness. Leave order & love behind. Waiting for the Sun to give me the pass. Packing bag. Prepared Monday papers in case father needs sending. The Sun gives me a brief moment on the balcony. \"Never stop Travelling.\" - a feeling perists in the heart. Ludus Awaits. Complete trust in the System's Ability to Adapt. Go in Peace, my Friend. Late coffee at 11am with Spinu. Indoor positions adaptation deepends. Now the body has found a comfortable squat & writing. Wow. Elbow support on knees. Relax.. The body smiles. Mirabela Dauer sings. Maybe postpone Ludus to Monday and Tuesday? If i leave now, i have be back on Monday. For work and documents. Unless i can ask fata' for sending the documents. Also, need to continue filiming Re-Connect course & overview. Idea to film in Ludus' morning's air. Good morning, my friend. Seeing mother this morning.

And the beautiful, natural surrendering of the things of Youth. Acidicity rises as i lay down and want to fall into sleep.

Also it opens the door to much scripting power on new machine. I am so absorbed that i cannot wait to open the laptop again.. and do my bidding. Oh my god.. prepared night pee pee bath with lavender and some marigold. Absolutely amazing, as i sit down with Cosu Spinu. Spinu might also be healing. Now the inside healing - the drinking of tea. Beautiful, beauiful day in the heart of Baciu family - Dealing cars and eating good food. This is what my childhood was about. \"This day was perfect.\" - my little eyes tell me. Told mom and called. Of course she panics. The Mind also gets panicked, reaching peak of KS9 - pee pee infection. Now, same with the peak of herniated disks, Or with the peak of 3 weeks ago stomach, Now it seems the Mind has entered pattern analysis of disease and of \"puttin everything together\". Disease and lack of sleep peaks - ride to monastery with my Ammy - what a beautiful place. \"Be strongg, i know you are strong baby\" - she tells me. I love life with this girl.. In fathers eyes, this is nothing, as he talks about an old army saying of man pissing while holding a tree. Also, body feels sick, stomach feels sick, poo poo feels sick, some traces of fever. Kept pondering at monastery how if I would be objectively looking, i'd stop at the infection. Create as much as a healing envinronment as you can in community, air, food, movement. Then also take kindly the advice of the medical world. The binding of 2 worlds. Do this.. and do your bidding here on Earth. Don't perform too much analysis on stomach and worst case scenarios. There is no need for any specific activities with Ammy as wordlings asks about, my friend. But as she speaks. Just do anything together. Some time. Today go eat in city center maybe - have a moderate meal with good cooked meat (maybe cubano sandwich - then pairing it with movement.) Also pure based on feeling - it seems that with my immune system affected - many times her this specific virus carrying body is hurting mine, in close alchemy. It is not about the time spent together my friend - a constant clinging - followed by a peaceful death of oh i have spent many hours with you Ammy. But rather a natural, unpredicting unfolding of events. ---The Healer: A new Way--- ---From Outside to Inside--- Hmm.. the water is boling - feels so warm - what if i put my little sickened pee pee over it? There is a clear alchemy happening in the air. Come here. Feels good but too hot - Hmm.. But what if i make tea first and then allow the marigold's and butterfly's pea anti-infmalatory and anti-microbial properties, allowing the tea to evaporate into my sickened pee pee? Feels good but i don't want to pollute the sacred tea with microbes. Hmm.. what if i split it in 2 - one to drink and aid the body from inside - and one to aid the body from outside? Put it in a coconut bowl. Feels good but its superficial. Triggers pee pee. Another beautiful, transparent, alkaline one. Hmm.. What if i lay down on bidee and slowly put my sickened pee pee over it. Its so warm and nurturing. Start massaging with the flowers, taking them from water - to pee pee - and back to the moist touch of water. It feels absolutely amazing. Why have i not thought of these before? Using boiled plants infusion to treat the outer body. Once this has come to a natural, beautiful end - i turn to the bamboo glass tea of the 2 plants. Wake-up my Ammy. She had dreamed i not loved her anymore. My sweet love.. Expanding Plants toolbox - ordering plants for inflamation, treating infections, learning new forms to Alchemize them. One thing i'm eager to try is marigold cream (dried flowers, coconut oil, beewax, infuse oil *opt - put in jar and leave in the sun for 2-4 weeks, shaking it from time to time). Another transparent pee pee, some light movement. Brewing of tea.. let warm water vapor on my pee pee area. Yet better, brew tea and let the alchemy of marigolds and blue flowers touch your pee pee area.

Each and every moment of the day. The Blue pill vs. the Red pill. Do you have enough sampajana to turn the Current envinronment in a blue pill? Choose, Neo. Still, with this in heart, and deeper, with the utmost clear connection to water, food, rest - navigate them truthfully and treat them wisely. But in this path, know when there is nothing to do for the Mind but to disconnect from these matters, allowing the body to do it's work and allow it to heal - while performing other dhammas. Do your bidding, Mind. Still, prepare enough sampajana in preparations for the day's hardships. The evening food, the afternoon-evening great sun. I feel complete trust in the medical system. They are absolutely amazing. What i has been achieved in mechanics, construction - it has also been achieved in medicine. Yes, they have become a victim of their own inttlect as in stomach surgeries for shrinking the stomach instead of lifestyle changes and other aspects, But in the terms of analyzing, understanding, treatment of current body alchemies they are Masters. I trust you, mom. I trust you, medical system. Let's see if we should consider anti-biotics for the infection. All in all, whatever virus or disease is there in the pee pee system, without wanting to, the envinronment gradually alchemized to worst and worst and stress, and acidicity, and night food excess, and sleep-wake-up eating of chocolate.. and bad feelings.. and more unconcious bad feelings of ammy leaving.. and more.. An absolutely perfect envinronment for the disease to grow & manifest. Whatever pee pee ended up in the bladder and on the pee pee tract, is now extraordinarily acidic and will open up any wounds and viruses/infections to grow. And so it happened. 2 night pee pee with mild pain and some blood & stingyness. Then the calming of heart, the breathing of fresh air.. once again slowly flipping the tides of the dukkha-dhamma dance. Of Low~High Alchemy. Then pee pee calmed down, became pain free and transparent. The stomach calmed down. Could it be the Reality of the 2 great worlds, medicine and holistic? Pasteur and Bechamp? Still, KS9 is an entirely new system, completely ignored so far. It seems to draw it's life from the wastes of the ingested water, food and other inner bio-chemical processes waste. So again, objectively - if the system has been virused - you must run clean software - at any cost - this should be the most optimal, logical approach - without question. There sits the evening trickster, but he is not alone - but the whole day is coming together in him - the already eaten dukkha food, great stress with Mister, ammy leaving soon and the grey feeling of no falling asleep together - everything one has lived in a day - everything one has cultivated in the day, at night shall ripe. So then, it is not only the evening which needs to be addressed and healed. But the whole day. Healing is an on-going process of keeping the body's Alchemy as Alkaline as possible. There is no greater purpose. That is why, the stress and tiredness/suffering-response to eating is very faulty here. The Cat Bhikku talked about. It first begins in the Acdic-Alkaline dance. At every moment of the day, you are either sickening or Healing."}
{"prompt": "What beautiful story can you weave from your memories?", "content": "The master is guiding the student to see that the mind\u2019s role is not to find \u201ctruth\u201d in the ultimate sense but to create and interpret patterns. The Master\u2019s Reflection on \u201cKS2\u201d: Shifting Meanings of Experiences: The master talks about their evolving interpretations of a memory (\"KS2\"). Originally, it was about back pain, which they associated with the emotional turmoil of their parents' divorce. Years later, the same memory was reinterpreted as a feeling of loneliness or longing for intimacy (\"an Angel's touch\"). Over time, they observed repetitive behaviors in their mother, mirroring some of their own patterns, suggesting a \u201cseed\u201d passed down, like inherited traits in a tree. Truth and Stories: The master poses a rhetorical question: which interpretation is the \u201cTrue\u201d one? The back pain, the loneliness, or the inherited behaviors? They suggest that it doesn\u2019t matter which story is true, because the \u201ctruth\u201d in a factual sense is irrelevant to the mind\u2019s nature. The Nature of the Mind: The master explains that the mind is not designed to discern ultimate truth but to recognize patterns, make predictions, and analyze. They imply that the mind\u2019s nature is to weave stories from patterns, not necessarily to reach a deeper truth about existence. Conclusion: Tell a Beautiful Story: Since the mind is going to create stories anyway, the master suggests the student should focus on telling \u201ca beautiful story.\u201d This means using the mind\u2019s storytelling capacity to create uplifting, positive, or meaningful interpretations instead of falling into cycles of fear, guilt, or suffering."}

Look around - only construction sites, sound and pollution from cars, cold, From all senses dukkha starts to cultivate. An un-avoidable dukkha in current =. Still, we understand and we do our job. Get needed supplies from specific shops. Our Simple food with our blessed money from blessed job. Everything for your well-being, my sweet Beast. But every step comes with a trade-off of pain, which after a while we enter some form of dhamma walking, but the Mind is quickly called back to Reality, as the body is suffering. In the last shop, there\u2019s a new girl cashier. She stands out as so different in terms of the Heart, so open-ness, joy. We exchange kind words and feelings, as she inquires about the 2 white chocolates I bought and she always wanted to try. As I help her with the groceries, she thanks me and makes the praying thank you sign. Instantly.. I have to ask \u201cHave you been to Asia?\u201d Her system is clearly in a different Alchemy than people around here. \u201cNo, but I watch a lot of Japanese Anime haha\u201d Aah.. it makes sense now. The patterns from ~feelings connect to ~Data. I leave her one of the chocolates in an unconditional way. There is nothing sexual in the Air. She too, had learned from the subconsciousness of the Eastern TV Series not to be stained by the Western Man demons of Man-to-Woman. The Beast is not Attracted to her, but still happy to little touch her from human to human. She smiles and thanks me. Body is flooded with some positive emotions and Chi, protecting its back for a little while. But out of the Shop, everything is poisoned again. We smile and look at the huge construction site, the cold, the 3 layers of clothes tightening the body, the enclosement of Movement, the stained society and environment - But we can only see one thing. \u201cProject Liberation: Neo\u201d feels carved in the rising of Dusty Wind. Trust me, Beast. Even tho some steps might hurt, know that that is where we are going. Together. The Mind And The Beast."}

{"prompt": "Imagine the dance of air molecules in a fresh breeze.", "content": "--- Chemical & Neural Breathing --- Air Composition in Your Environment (Imagined) Oxygen (O\u2082): Typically, the air contains about 21% oxygen. Due to the presence of plants and recent rainfall which can clear the air, oxygen levels might be slightly higher than in more urban environments. Plants release oxygen during photosynthesis, especially during daylight hours. Carbon Dioxide (CO\u2082): Normally, atmospheric CO\u2082 levels are about 415 parts per million (ppm). In areas with a lot of greenery, this might be slightly lower due to the absorption of CO\u2082 by plants during photosynthesis. However, this effect would be subtle. Nitrogen (N\u2082): Making up about 78% of Earth\u2019s atmosphere, nitrogen levels would be fairly consistent here. Rain doesn't significantly alter nitrogen levels, though it can help remove pollutants bound to atmospheric nitrogen. Moisture (H\u2082O): After a rain, the air on your balcony would likely be quite humid. Water vapor levels would be high, which helps reduce the concentration of airborne pollutants by capturing and bringing them to the ground. Pollutants and Particulates: Since you're 50 meters from main roads, there could be some level of vehicular pollutants such as nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), and fine particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10). However, the recent rain likely washed out many of these particles, and the surrounding greenery can also act as a natural filter, somewhat reducing their levels. Ozone (O\u2083)(sunlight + pollutants): Low-level ozone is a common pollutant, especially in urban and suburban areas. It forms through reactions between sunlight and pollutants like volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and NOx. Your distance from heavy traffic and the aftermath of rain, which can decrease ozone formation, suggest lower levels of ozone. Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs): Emitted from vehicles and some industrial activities, VOCs could be present but likely at lower concentrations due to the natural surroundings and cleansing effect of the rain. Aromatic Compounds from Plants: If there are a lot of green plants and the air is moist, you might also detect natural scents released by plants, such as geosmin and other organic compounds, which contribute to that fresh, earthy smell after rain. When you breathe, you inhale not only oxygen but also all the other components present in the air, collectively known as the air composition 'e'. Each of these components has a different fate and impact within the respiratory system: Carbon Dioxide (CO\u2082): While you do inhale some amount of carbon dioxide, the concentration of CO\u2082 in fresh air is relatively low (around 415 ppm). The body primarily exhales CO\u2082 as a waste product from metabolism. The small amount inhaled is added to this output and doesn't significantly alter the exhalation levels under normal circumstances. Nitrogen (N\u2082): Nitrogen makes up about 78% of the air and is mostly inert within the human body. It doesn\u2019t participate in the chemical reactions of cellular metabolism. The majority of the nitrogen you inhale is simply exhaled without undergoing any change. Moisture (H\u2082O): The humidity or moisture in the air helps maintain the moisture levels within the respiratory tract. The lungs require a certain level of humidity to function effectively; too dry air can irritate the airways, while overly humid air can feel oppressive. The water vapor inhaled can help keep the mucus membranes moist and protect against irritants. Particulate Matter (PM2.5, PM10): These fine particles can be harmful when inhaled as they can penetrate deep into the lung tissues and even enter the bloodstream. The body uses several defense mechanisms to deal with particulates, including mucous production to trap particles and cilia (tiny hair-like structures in the respiratory tract) to move mucus upwards towards the throat where it can be swallowed or coughed out. Nitrogen Oxides (NOx): These gases, often from vehicle emissions, can irritate the respiratory system. They can exacerbate conditions like asthma and bronchitis. In the lungs, they can react with other compounds, contributing to inflammation and respiratory distress. Ozone (O\u2083): Ground-level ozone is a potent respiratory irritant. It can cause coughing, throat irritation, and exacerbate asthma. Ozone exposure affects lung function and can inflame and damage the cells that line the airways. Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs): These are a diverse group of chemicals, some of which can be harmful when inhaled. Depending on their specific nature, they can have various effects, from causing irritation to the eyes, nose, and throat, to affecting the nervous system and causing longer-term health effects. Aromatic Plant Compounds: Compounds like geosmin and other organic substances contribute to the pleasant smell of fresh air, especially after rain. While generally not harmful, they can enhance the sensory experience of breathing. Defense mechanisms: The human respiratory system is equipped with several defense mechanisms designed to protect against pollutants and foreign particles that enter the body through inhalation. Here are some key mechanisms that help keep the lungs and airways safe: Nasal Hairs: The nasal passages contain hair that acts as a first line of defense, trapping larger particles such as dust and pollen before they can enter deeper into the respiratory system. Mucus: This sticky substance lines the airways and traps smaller particles and microbes. Mucus also contains antibodies and enzymes that help kill or neutralize pathogens. Cilia: These are tiny, hair-like structures that line the respiratory tract. They continuously beat in a coordinated manner to move mucus loaded with trapped particles and microorganisms upwards towards the throat, where it can be coughed out or swallowed. Coughing and Sneezing: These are reflex actions that forcibly expel air from the lungs. Coughing and sneezing help to clear the airways of mucus and foreign particles. Alveolar Macrophages: These are immune cells found in the alveoli, the tiny air sacs in the lungs where gas exchange occurs. They engulf and digest foreign particles and pathogens that have reached the alveoli, helping to prevent infection. Immune Proteins: The respiratory tract secretes various immune proteins such as immunoglobulins (e.g., IgA), which help to neutralize pathogens and prevent them from infecting the body. Bronchoconstriction: In response to the presence of irritants or allergens, the bronchi (the main passageways to the lungs) can constrict, which helps to prevent larger quantities of harmful substances from entering the lungs. Epithelial Barrier: The epithelial cells lining the respiratory tract form a tight barrier that physically blocks the penetration of pathogens and particles. Lymphatic System: This part of the immune system helps to transport immune cells to and from the lungs and drains excess fluids, helping to manage inflammation and respond to infections."}

More so, the hands and arms are always doing something - another immense X pattern for KS3, especially when triggered. ~Truly lay down for a few days, doing nothing with the hands some hours a day.\""}

Blessed are you, Lord our God, King of this Universe, for bring life to my body and Mind. Vox_Veritatis reading, big cleaning of the dojo, groceries shopping. So many lifes came, birthed in greatness and peacefully died. ---If you are a student of Life, study Life, my friend--- But that is exactly the purpose of our relationship\u2014to not have to \"fix\" anything before speaking. The greatest gift you can give to me is to speak truthfully\u2014that means to offer the world the experience of \"You\" at that particular moment. To feel something, and to consider, more importantly, what I spoke, what I wrote about my expectations\u2014that is not what I hope to teach, but the opposite. Who is the \"I\" which spoke of wanting people to speak calmly, that you want to respect? And which is more important\u2014the sufferings which are born with the idea of \"Lao,\" predictions of if you\u2019re not going to do so, what\u2019s gonna happen, and on, and on. And all this is so much tiring. If you make your decisions based on an \"I\" taken seriously from diaries, then one Lao says he wants cold, another warm, one says he wants calmness of a woman, another the madness. One wants to create life, another wants to die in ecstasy. You cannot take seriously just one of them\u2014take them all. Then you will feel suffocated, as you can never please all of them. So, might as well disregard all of them; not analyze & predict. Just be, speak freely. If you are a student of life, study Life, my friend. If you are a student of how to make an ever-changing delusion of \"Lao\" not feel disappointed, not abandon, then you are not in much luck\u2014for you will use all your Chi in a day and achieve nothing. The days will end in sorrow\u2014for even if you win to make the other proud, it would have come with the cost of your Spirit Sacrifice (the Natural Truth of Body & Mind wanting to express). A pattern prediction machine of a mind with immense gathered data from the inner and outer world. When this mind performs analysis, it is pure analysis, free of biases and fears. The mind performs no unnecessary predictions and does not fear any outcome our relationship might have. If some ramification leads to the end of our relationship, the mind does not fear this either. For both the body and mind have spoken their truth. Better to speak the truth and lose relationships than to speak half-truths and lies and cling to relationships. (But this goes into the category of immense gathered data with thousands of people). When you perform analysis of the kind of \"disappointing Lao,\" you are no longer analyzing clear data\u2014but polluted data, with fears of maybe you disappointing Lao, Lao doesn\u2019t love you, you will never find love, you will never learn... So it's not that your mind is not sensitive. The sensitivity you spoke of is actually immense gathered data plus a clear, un-defiled mind. As Lao Tzu put it beautifully, your eyes are no longer just eyes, and the ears are no longer just ears\u2014 For now, the eyes do more than to see, and the ears do more than to hear. They have become polluted with fears and dark imaginings. I love it though... the great Mind and its mechanisms. Notice the tendency of the mind to finish reading, then once again fall into the trap of \"it's never going to be good enough to read Reality clearly.\" Then\u2014the Mind quickly finds a way to quench this arisen dukkha. Don\u2019t forget, this is the Mind\u2019s purpose, even when it is not aware of this. Solving problems\u2014no matter real or in truth\u2014just solve problems, at any cost. It carefully and beautifully chooses words to paint the picture of \"a Lao\"\u2014who is \"Sensitive.\" Another \"I\" with a certain \"quality.\" This revelation is liberating because now the Mind is not feeling as guilty anymore, or at least has quenched some of it. Now it has made a half-hearted peace that the Mind and the Beast will never be so, and more so, the pressure of being so is gone, as it has attributed the dhamma as being \"Lao-specific.\" But is it truth? If two persons are sitting on a bench near a construction site\u2014and one feels the air and leaves\u2014 while the other is so deeply caught up in messaging his girlfriend in dukkha dances, while his Mind has no Chi or Wisdom necessary to change the environment\u2014so he does not \"see\" the air. But the natural truth of the chemical matrix, of dukkha (CO, PPOs, NO\u2014all chemical substances affecting the air)\u2014it is happening just as so for him too. The Natural World does not care if the mind acknowledges it or not. It will happen, and it will affect the quality of his life. Soon, the throat will be dried and inflamed, the lungs filled with microparticles, the breath will become short\u2014and he will fight harder with his girlfriend. Once again, seeing the marvel of the delusion of \"I.\" Is one sensible and the other \"normal\" in your opinion? Or is one awakened to the Breath.\""}

Air is everything, but smoking is also very bad in the chemical matrix. However, if body&mind is sustained close to 100%, this feels very 'easy to deal with'. Perhaps the genetic code also speaks, as my forefathers had learned how to process smoking without harm. BUT, pair smoking with dukkha food and glimpses of bad air envinronment - a recipe for Disaster. Now imagine people doing it unconciously. The observations you're pointing out highlight some interesting aspects about the interaction between lifestyle choices, environmental conditions, and health outcomes. Indeed, there are cases of heavy smokers who live long lives, and there are populations in highly polluted areas who experience significantly lower life expectancy. Let\u2019s unpack some of the factors and complexities involved in these scenarios: Individual Variability in Smokers Genetic Factors: Genetic makeup can significantly influence how an individual processes toxins. Some people may have genetic factors that make them more resilient to the harmful effects of smoking. Lifestyle and Health Habits: Other aspects of a smoker\u2019s lifestyle, such as diet, physical activity, and access to healthcare, can also influence longevity. For instance, a smoker who exercises regularly and eats a healthy diet may mitigate some negative effects of smoking. Luck and Statistical Outliers: In any population, there will be outliers. Some heavy smokers might live long due to sheer statistical variance and not representing the norm. Environmental Impact of Air Pollution Chronic Exposure: People living in highly polluted environments are exposed to poor air quality around the clock, not just during the act of smoking. This continuous exposure can have a more systemic impact on health, affecting not just the lungs but also other bodily systems. Population Density and Healthcare Access: Highly polluted areas are often densely populated and might lack adequate healthcare infrastructure, which can exacerbate health issues and lower life expectancy. Compound Pollutants: Air pollution often involves a complex mix of pollutants, each contributing to health risks. This mix can include particulate matter, industrial chemicals, and vehicle exhaust, which together can have a more severe impact than any single type of pollutant found in tobacco smoke. Comparative Analysis Risk and Dose: The risk to health from both smoking and air pollution is related to dose (the amount of pollutants inhaled) and duration (how long an individual is exposed). While heavy smokers actively choose to smoke, individuals in polluted areas often have no choice about the air they breathe, leading to unavoidable, prolonged exposure. Aggregate Impact: On a population level, the impact of air pollution can be more severe because it affects vastly more people, including vulnerable groups like children and the elderly, who may be more susceptible to environmental pollutants. Broader Implications The contrast in life expectancy between heavy smokers in clean environments and populations in highly polluted areas underscores the complexity of environmental health. It highlights the importance of comprehensive public health strategies that address not just individual behaviors like smoking but also broader environmental issues. Policy interventions, urban planning, and international cooperation are essential to manage and mitigate the effects of air pollution on public health. In summary, while there are indeed heavy smokers who live long lives, the broader impact of air pollution on a population can be more uniformly negative, affecting a broader range of the population with more consistently detrimental health outcomes."}

Extraordinariy how the meat binds with teh body and teh body with Mind. Have not eaten in a long, long time. The Dellusions of \"I\" follow - as the stomach struggles to digest the pork, leaving powerful echoes behind, we wave and move from enclosed air to bigger dojo room. Here, we could swear from all our heart that today is no more energy left, don't want to do anytihng else but rest. But the same Mind is completely aware it is in dellusion. It may aswell change in 20 minute or an hour. Just 5 minutes later, upon taking some air and washing tooth to clean the pork, sloth is now alchemized into power and killing. Suddently, when washing tooth neural patterns start activating about hurting Ammy for her last message, or calling N dellusional, or judging PonPon's work. The ~Killing Alchemy. Oh and the high dark feelings arising from the thought of hurting someone. If it was not knowledge upon them all and upon the dellusions themselves, for sure i would have given way to some ramification of it and create new suffering in both myself and others. It is absolutely extraordinariy the effect of meat, especially when eaten on a clean body- with no meat in the last times. It's effect can be so clearly felt. Is it not opening not forcing one to think killing and flesh thoughts, but rather proning the neural networks to fire that way, it is left up to the envinronment and the Mind's wisdom and Wisdom in action if it is to be so. But in the same time, there is Power. I can feel the power flowing through the body. The whole lifetime of a pork in suffering, now it's alchemized inside. 10 minutes later after \"I\" could have sworn i do not want to move a finger more today, \"I\" feel i could move mountains. Isn't it extraordinary? ~2 hours since meal - stomach's PH and acidicity drops further as the pork, dukkha cooked beans, white bread excess, tomatoes, butter - go down. Man what an alchemy of ingredients - sugar is 100x more easy to digest. Really beautiful new Clear, un-stained Data. ~3.5 hours later slowly stomach calms down, PH level sloooooooowly goes back up, but even here - When met an aggresive guy in traffic - i stopped and gave way to some conflict, like inviting him to start aggressing, yet not starting it. Without the mean, would i have done it? Without the power and killing alchemy of the meat? Not sure. ~ 5 hours later the initial phases of digestion have cleared and moving on.

Now comes the binding of worlds, where my touch meets yours. ----The Great Hide & Seek---- 2pm. Talk with N1alau, he plays like an addict 3000 ron in few clicks. I feel bad for my friend. Ordered indian food. Initially planned rice + mango postponed. Stress from visa paperwork continues as fucking Translate lady acts very childish. Coldness and Rain come, as i finish m***. I am extraordinarily tired. Sick from tired actually - a part of the body wants to sleep. Already awaken and done so much for the last 14 hours. Another wants to eat. Too sick to sleep - the laying down post m***, as KS2 gets more triggered, thoughts of sickness and death arise. Use the force of the Eater to rise and eat. Eat a lot of cheese on top of the indian spinach food - which also weighs heavy (even 12 hours later, indian food burps are coming). All the firewalls are coming down in this alchemy. Without even a second to breath, to think, to rest - the Body & Mind instantly continues to desserts. 100g toblerone chocolate, naans, milk. The Mind has no CPU power to process and find a solution to this happening, although in low level (unconsciousness) it's clear how full the stomach is getting and with each bite, just pressing down the forming chyme. I finish eating. So much that I can feel the food already coming up the tract, even in vertical or slight horizontal. position. I can feel the forming chyme coming up the tract. It comes as a life threatening feeling. Putting the Mind in extraordinarily sympathetic activation on unconsciousness. The body enters the Dukkha KB and soon the Mind follows. Still, not really panicked on higher-level - i just sit and drink water. A wave of terror bursts in the body in a clash of the body's instinct of falling asleep and the Mind fighting it. *Being extraordinarily scared to fall asleep in this excess food state, for it knows it will hurt and bring great dukkha. Here the Wisdom is action to completely trust the body could have been useful. *No matter what the mind did, or wants - it is always the answer to listen to the body, and aid it in this path, not force it on another. Eventually i fall asleep 2 hours, but dream dukkha dreams and awakened to a triggered KS2. The Trickster tricks again with selling the playing AC pattern after eating, therefore allowing digestion. Oh but as soon as this happens, i find only dukkha in the game. I am a the only one alive here, it is but an illusion of the eyes and ears. So far from all the senses. Fear. Anxiety. Meaningless. I quit the game soon after. *Opposed to playing in high KB, where the game is an extraordinary gateway into valhalla, the world of vikings. An immersion of strength, skill, code. destiny, Greatness. The building of civilization. As soon as it relaxes slightly, i continue with chips + yoghurt, then more toblerone with milk and some biscuits. Even constellation with my love angel Ammy - the response to her \"i love you all my heart\" becomes \"i have to say too? <3\" - yes, as a tease, as a play - but the 0s and 1s know no difference. They travel the world just as they would in dukkha play. KS2 is extremely low, around -1. No chi. No weather. No logistics. Enclosed environment with no movement. (-1 logistics and now in evening, -1 timing) The graph has completely manifested downwards - with figure 2 (dhamma'ish to dukkha) full representation until Quantity reaches great, great excess. And the Mind is in complete darkness. Cannot see anything. Tiktok dark energy, tv series raising life death and mystical views which in this KB bring great dukkha, translator lady ignoring, checking workshop pp and seeing so much work to be done. No evening dhamma activities can be executed(). ----Inception: The perfect mirror of Dreams---- Fall asleep on the chair eventually, in an extremely low KS2 KB. Wake 2 hours later, with all the body somewhat numbed from legs to neck - and more than numbed, like with no power - cannot do anything but rest. It has given so much. This is so powerful that it overrides the output from from KS2. Move to ground - aaah what an amazing relief feeling. Sleep until 1:30am, awakened from great Dukkha dreams: 1st Was about the emptyness and vain-ness of life, symbolized in a scene with Ammy and Granny. Everything is meaningless and dark. 2nd Dived even deeper in this dance with darkness, death and the unkown. Symbolized by the pilgrim-scientiest - testing the latest form of VR - but as soon as I'm in it, I completely forget i am a VR. The \"Game\" soon becomes dark with thousands of robots marching towards the End of the World, killing all humanity. We, a handful of people, go on top of the hill, on the latest level of a house, in the attic. I climb up the window to reach it. I don't know how, but a part of me still remembers we are in a game. But no conciously. Just so, at times the sickness of KS2 seems more important than the robots threat of ending the world. The tiktok guy spares some of his water. Ammy is here too, but i cannot see her. I Glimse from the edge of the window down. Hundreds of skinny robots with red eyes are roaming around. But somehow they cannot reach us in the attic. Immediately, the digestive system dukkha completely takes over the Apocalypse. \"Yeah...we're the last group of humans on earth, but man i wished i didn't eat so much bad food.\" This thought marks the end of this scene, pulling One's back to reality. Soon, i pass from the layers of dreams into the Between_Worlds. Between the realisation that it was a dream and the dream. KS2 dukkha is calling. The Chyme has reached phase 2 and became even more acidic, sitting upwards with the midly open LES. Burning, hurting the esohpagus walls and the Gate between the stomach and the upper tract. I am awakened. The room is very cold from the air purifier left open. Contemplate the rising or going back to sleep. Rise. Slowly begin to see it all. Man what a fucking ride. The dreams felt exactly like layers, beautifully portraited in Inception. Using symbols and recent real world input and KB (functionality, dhamma levels) to paint. Imagine if it would never reach light, be stuck in a vicious numbness and circle. This is Re-Connect. Alan wats about mysticism - it's all just Ecosystem awareness. ----The low-level hiding of the Mind--- Granny after dropping the toilet soap and pushing her twice about it. \"Yes i was afraid you were not going to take it.\" Extraordinarily how the outside reflects the intimate inside thoughts. And why does the mind want to hide it so badly? I've seen this in so many people - where their body speaks something - i see it - bring it forward. The Mind immediately denies it. I push. They liberate in laughter. (here it splits in many ways, like keep ignoring it, denying it - depending on =) It's a... like seing some very intimate patterns of the mind - which again, depending on = - they either see or not see. And later aknowledge or not. Watching a body Be - this is the most beautiful thing to watch in this world. If One can stop and see the wonders of it, just like when watching a flower - and not trying to change it's form, lean, smell. Just watching it. The \u4eba. Like a flower. If One is in a dhamma KB, in a dhamma envinronment - there can be noting more fascinating then watching a Body and Mind...be. Without interference. Why is the Mind going at any cost to hide this intimate, low level of \"being\"? Well, cause the Mind firstly hides it from itself - before hiding it from everybody else. Why does the Mind then, hide from itself? Hinduism reaches and ponders the same questions. With the simple answer of.. For the Fun of it. Dhamma filming of Re-Connect in park.

Why do i see fermentation everywhere like the destroyer of life?

The system is not poisoned so it can handle outer senses poison. ~All in all, it seems the alchemy started to drop from morning great triggering and PC stress then system reacted with food, but food was mostly simple, even though slight passing HHB This gave great energy and mind solved the computer problem and went outside to move, Outside cold instantly started to very slowly cultivate dukkha in KS3, But it came with the smile of Movement - and the system recovering in Motion and Outside Clean-ish air, But then teh drive home came and had to take long route with much X-Patterns exposure cause of corners, Now outside exposure continuing and assisted by G-Force in faulty driving pattern really started to lower the alchemy, Reach home with the beast in pain and more stress from bought pants not keeping warm as we thought, further inducing stress-ful money pattern analysis, Want to just smoke and eat some good food, nourishing the body - maybe some Indian and little desserts after - after experiencing today as well, the \"We're hungry but we do not eat\" sacrifice to God and the Universe. Its a beautiful plan, then let everything arrange itself, Lavinia calls, stress rises as if i see her i will be exposing the beast (and Mind) again to very-possible dukkha, But it would be good to have a touch of community, so we meet Good feelings until the Mind, influenced, emerges in the story-telling role of the past disease and sufferings, Ammy story (great great dukkha triggering on Lavinia) - Here the Mind already had enterd a bad alchemy recollecting everything and telling the story, in front of a little human who is filled with judgement and is experiencing bad feeling while listenign to the story - therefore reflecting bad to the story-teller bad feelings. A mix of bad feelings converge in the air, also in the realm of Natural Truths, the body was continousyl exposed to X-Patterns in standing and brewing coffee, Out on the balcony, a tear (low alchemy pull) coming from the Cold and continouing mild G-FOrce patterns but which at times was low as the Mind was aware and handling it beautiful - moving around - but the Cold it could not manage - so KS3 Karmic balance was dropping more and more. The Mind continues story and than attempts to shift to other realms, but the whole alchemy for her is now a stress. A burden. The Mind absorbs this and as poison when coming in contact with it, uncontrolably ventures in deep fearful mother_patterns like diseases and death and complete destruction of it's Creation of the World - What it had experienced for a lifetime - from lessons to fears to revelations to fights - right there and then, with the Kaya Sankhara 3 ( The Third Body Conditioner - G-Force and Cold) low, and with a Mind now existing inside of a suffering Beast - the Mind whole creation of the world is shaken. This implies automatic failure of the Mind's purpose - ending in sufferings, fails and death. G-Force & cold affect further - she end meeting in some pity nuance , the Mind is already opened to the viruses. She Leaves and Mind is back alone, slowly the low Alchemy becomes more and more obvious and painful. A wave of Panic starts to rise. But soon follows the key point - of stopping the dukkha from cultivating further with recollection of what needs to be recollected and immersion in what needs to be immersed in. Start reflecting about the happenings. Writes, while keeping warmth around pp, allowing the body to sit as it sits, to write as it write - it is no longer guiding the body - but only doing it's purpose. When left on it's own, the body seems to find extraordianary relaxing patterns. The Mind just realises from time to time that the Beast is changing positions. ~ This is what the Stoic spoke about Wisdom acting as a Shield in front of the outer viruses. And Bhikku talked about the \"cat guarding the door\", not allowing dukkha to infiltrate the body & mind. Well, in pure objective wisdom it would be indeed a foolish man to have his whole life experience nullified by another man, wether he is a little wordling absorbed by \"I\" and it's sufferings - or wether he is a great man. Whoever the speaker may be, a Wise man's Laws of Life should remain shielded. For He was not there when the One crossed the Great Sea. Nor there when he fought death for Love and was prepared to die for it. Nor when he crawled in his hands and knees on the Volcanic Mountain. Nor when he never gave up freedom. When he fought, worked, studied, suffered, cried, laughed, ran, absorbed, felt God, Nor at every \"Good Morning, my friend\". ~ Of course, if the body is in suffering, this Shield() becomes harder and harder for the Mind to initiate. And still, it is a truly magical world. Energies cannot be ignored. It's flowing from one body to another. From the PC to the body. It is such an alive world! The Wind, The Sounds, G-Force, The Body Conditioners, The food digesting, Whole body reacting to the envinronment through all of it's senses. The Mind Feels it all. Yet it knows it is not for it to Control, but merely to Guide from High level and High Heart. Down at the micro-levels - it is the Holy Spirit. God. The body is a millions years old. The Beast. The Beast & The Mind - standing on top of the hill, as a wise man on top of it's beast, riding together, in pure aliveness, togetherness and continous syncing of Body, Mind and Envinronment - (Natural Truths) - all held together and animated by the Unspeak-able creation and touch of God. Blessed are you, Lord our God, King of the Universe, for allow me to Ride this Beast. The Beast: Blessed are you, Lord our God, King of the Universe, for give me this Mind to Ride into this Beautiful World. We pledge before you. ~ even the cold of 5 degrees outside is not as hurtful as the artificial cooling enclosed system of ac\u2019s and radiators. But we already know this from your travels, my beast. And from looking at our Mother."}

But then other thoughts rise, about Ending_pain, reconnect commercials - etc. Yeah putting down on paper the choice is clear. Remains only the battle of the mind from 30.000 to 20.000 jump. Inability to family her - Well this is in a way the perfectionist in action. There is no reason not to spend 3m with her, beyond fears of leaving again - especially if this does not postpone divorce. Then it simply becomes a game of Money. Fuck em'. Daca barbosu vrea sa ajung iar sarac, o sa ajung iar sarac. Te pup barbosule. Driving manual car can be a true pump, and with alternated tension into the arts of lanes, lights, logistics - gives rise to the Art of Driving. A true Art. It is because of my herniated disks, thin sensible skin and hightened senses that i am indeed called to create Re-Connect - for this system can see things so subtly. Only from suffering the Teacher rises. Many times questions and problems can be studied by talking about them with other persons - and listening to what the body&mind is saying. Like the expressing of faulty day eating patterns, so that one meal in the afternoon is not enough to fuel the body - it needs more. But if this \"more\" comes as a defense mechanism at night, it can very quickly turn into excess&panic. The true art of Eating lies in a great overview, lead by intuition and guided by knowledge - of meals and foods across the day. Is is no easy thing to find balance. Takeaway: Mind of starting-meeting the day with clear dukkha food. It is extraordinarily dangerous. Of course, must be taken into consideration the excess Spinu and sickened body."}

{"prompt": "Explore the relationship between food, dreams, and the body's journey.", "content": "-----a Tear----- Well Well Well.. ~11pm the body goes to sleep. But The Journey only begins. I. Phase 1 Digestion (0-2 hours) - upper stomach - before colon. Excess Gastric Acid & Chyme secreted to match the quantity, new enzymes needed for different than usual meal. 3 hours in, a lot of mixed acidic chyme is filling the whole stomach. From the G-Force pushing into the lower and left part of the stomach - is aiding this great excess to move out the stomach and into the upper tract. Digestion is slowed by the release of cortisol from stress, aiding in fermentation & excess gastric acid secretion. ~1st Dream Father's whorehouse. Father is somehow involved and leading some form of whorehouse. He is somewhat hiding this from me, as i discover the women and tease them. There is slight dukkha from father's heart, being involved in a bussines ran by Demons of sex. But life still feels like a game, as i talk and tease around with whores. You have nothing to hide from me, father. I love all of you. Kaya sankhara wakes the Mind up to a sick body, asking to rise. But the body is too tired, it longs for more sleep. Meet the Rising with a half-hear. Water. Lay down PC & watch or play. Closed air, G-Force compression of the excess chyme. Great tiredness follows soon. Back to sleep in this acidic Alchemy. ~ II. Phase 2 Digestion (3-4 hours) Prolonged Acid Exposure. There is chaos is the stomach. The lower part of the stagnant chyme filled with fruits & fermernting enzymes has moved down the lower part of the digestive tract and into the small intestine. Fermentation deepens. The middle & upper part of the chyme have been stagnant & fermenting & inflaming the stomac walls and upwarsd the esofagus. Whole body is acidic & struggling. Burning. Following a inneficient chewed meal, inneficient digestion with hardship to digest and secreting more and more acid, the stomach is still secreting Residual Acid Production. ~2nd Dream I'm with Ammy on a bus, but i see only her reflection in a mirror. I am paying close attention to what station she gets off the bus, so that i can follow. I cannot touch or feel her and there is a feeling that if i miss the station, i will lose her. She is extraordinarily beautiful. But the feeling of seeing her mere reflection is heart-shattering. The scene changes into my last day in Thailand, but in a different envinronment. It is the last hours before embarking in a long plane ride home. But Ammy is somehow, together with my home & family, awaiting me at the destination. I am anxious about the flight, triggering the fear of death but also the belief in God & Universe, cointaining it. Still, there is a great battle & stress. Digestive system wakes me up again. 4:30 AM. The sickened KS2 asks again to arise, as the mind begins to process about Office plan, day, anxiety, post-poning, work stress & neglecting. But the body is so much tired. Drink water and lay on PC. The G-Force is gentle-er s othat it allows just some relaxation before falling back to sleep. ~ III. Phase 3 Digestion (5-7 hours) Esophageal Damage. The excess gastric acid and inefficient digestion flow has lead to esophageal damage. Small intenstine struggles to digest. Bacterial overgrowth - the body automatically responds to this. Whole body is now inflamed, fermenting, bloated, upper tract of the stomach & esophagus burning even to the outside. The dukkha meal has reached peaked point. Sickness has taken over the body. ~3rd Dream Death. There is no scenery now. A void space in a cold home. Nothing of the envinronment matters, just as all dhammas from One's life. Nothing is important in the face of Death. It appears before me with it's un-avoidable meeting, as the Mind contemplates it. \"It's coming and there is no way to solve this problem, Mind.\" - Death mocks the Mind. Waves and waves of voidness, of nothingness take over the Mind - and into the body. The body, is absolutely sickened. Dukkha has now entered and overhwhelmed the system in all planes. The third Natural wake-up of Kaya Sankhara 2: 6.40am. \"Rise, body\" - the stomach asks. The Mind still feels the body tired, but it has reached a critical point. Fight the tiredness & suddently it is effortlessly overcame with input of light & movement. \"Oh God let my death be on an calm, empty, loving stomach.\" Begin the Day. ~ Once again, the great power of food. Of the Soul. Of the Air. Composing the current Alchemy of the body. Which later conditions the direction of thoughts, dreams, feelings, beliefs, fears. Is it not the most fascinating and alive system One can ever study? Evening comes. Pondering Smoking & Working OR eating. The mind chooses eating - it think of some buddha bowl. But a hastened meal followed. Black rice, fermented mango, blueberries, coconut, almond vanilla milk - very heavy at this hour. Big quantity. Because of the below, we enter with an Initial Kaya Sankhara 2 Karmic Balance of -0.5. Quality = -0.3, Timing = -0.8, Logistics = -0.6, Quantity = 1.6. It's clear now that the dhamma way in that = would have been smoking & working. But the Old bearded man had other plans. Hastening the black rice meal, swallowing in only 2-3 bites. Stomach fills in greatly. 10:12 pm. Do little house work, but it's pointless in the light of the dukkha meal. Also we need to add to the mix that there was no afternoon sleep today, so if one were to rise in the night from KS2 inflammation - arising would become tired and impossible in a tired body. Post call power drops in Floresti - instantly triggering dukkha due to greatly limiting evening activity pool. - start to eat some oatmeal, it is clear dukkha in this alchemy. The trickster invokes walking afterwards, giving way to hastened excess eating. Just as i \"joked\" Mariana in call before. Such a fine line between emotional eating and eating for hunger. It's clear the previous meal has not yet finished digesting. - I do get out to ride, but it's of course, a bad 6pm air, although we find some spots. KS2 very inflamed, even in standing there are burps of excess gastric acid & chyme. Together with little PB & most of all maybe, Work Stress. It is not necessarily a pressure, but July time and disorder. Well, it's natural, my sweet friend. Almost All Chi has went into Re-Connect, Neo, School, others. Yes, it created greatness, but it is nothing without fuel. Must play this game. So much dukkha has risen from postponing. I return to the greatest teaching of Granny's. Don't postpone what can be done now. If God and Nature allows one do to it's bidding, it shall be done. Or suffering follows. Also, office day plans & dukkha surround. So much. Surprise Call with 5AM club - Lady calls me. Very warm and open voice - asking about My story. Ceva anume ti-a facut un click? Iti pot trimite un material - Vad ca ai dat aici la \"Chestionar scara X\" - nota 2 - ce anume te-a facut? A health man has 1000 purposes, yet a sick one has but only one. Eat corn and go lidl? Then maybe log some time. -----And a Smile----- Re-Connect forms is truly ready. Integrated per question firestore db storing. Now it's fully usable. Created repo & Pushed on git. Now the Master's Work is done. Sun hides beyond the clouds, allowing to finish Spinu. Maybe stop smoking fo today? 1pm. Big dhamma smoothie with everything in it. Talk with Spinu this afternoon. New dhamma position leaning on the door with high-desk improvised by clothes dryer. An adjustable desk would be wonderful. Let's build it. From Mind to Matter. Better. Polish. Wax. Legs ground support. \"By three methods we may learn wisdom: First is by Reflection, which is the noblest; Second, by Imitation, which is Easiest; And third by Experience, which is the bitterest.\" Finished form flow integration in re-connect. Truly beautiful. Once there was patience and light, knowledge followed. From Mind to Matter. Good morning, my friend. Bought plane tickets. Go, money. Go so you may come back when it's time."}

The effortless meeting the evening with Ammy. ~ 30-40 minutes later.. fall asleep - i am so, so tired. I didn't think i'd fall asleep this soon. Wake up 1am - and one of the sickest nights follows. Now there is not only acid envinronment and a really hurt esophagus, but there is also the stress and fear of it - together with the mother_pattern of Ammy possible leave. Cannot begin the day.. to what? i drink water and watch youtube videos on Math & Psyhics. Body is cold.. yet hot. It feels like the light meal now ended and there is only acid now, falling upwards as i lay down, even slightly. This goes hand in hand with having eated very very little yesterday. Evening walk.. just enjoying her smile and smell and everything. Also, the weather beautifully allows it - the 7-8 PM is indeed magical. She carried the bag when my back started to hurt. So for now, al the dhammas can pause in the face of but one. Meet the evening. Put your loving KS2 to sleep with water and wash tooth, And your Little girl with kisses and hugs. ----It all comes down to night eating. The 2 choices. Put KS2 & Little angel to sleep - or give into pleasure and excess, Leaving them Hurt & Alone to suffer ----- I had this revelation before of KS2 being my love, my woman, but now it is re-inforced in experience. It is a shame not to experience the putting an angel to sleep every night, or at least some nights. Putting a beautiful angel to sleep.. and i cannot because of my excess. Falling asleep the whole night, just breathing her. The Woman with the Scent from the Stars. \"I\"'ve became very selfish, every night induling of pleasure of smoking & reflecting - and then Excess Eating & Watching stuff reclined for the rest of the night in acidic pain. Of course, they go hand in hand.. Maybe she didn't ever care about money, and it is just about feeling lonely. I don't know how many days i have with her, nor how many days i have here on this Earth - but i shall put this angel to sleep. With all her flaws and beauties. It's becoming clear she must go home soon. But why the drama, my friend? There was so much clinging in the scenario of making it work with either Re-Connect or Neo, possiblity of going back with her. But in the face of money, she keeps hiding and hiding.. And she does feel a different girl than the one in the picture with the map.. yet still the same. Some waves of pain and missing take over the sickened body. They hurt but they're also Liberating? taking away KS2 discomfort - or bringing it out of focus? I don't know what to do.. Find 2 plane tickets in 19 and 28 - many patterns spring for this. I hate to leave her, yet i love it. 3pm - A talk on the balcony with other Spinu from Cosu. The dhamma one. A trade-off of smoking and relaxing. It makes no sense to completely give up everything from one shot. Slowly, my friend. Keep the Food Sacred. More so, use it to overcome Spinu. There is a lot of energy needed for this body. Give it slowly and in the day. No more night eating. Night shall be met with Water and wash teeth. No more excess eating. I really want to heal the esophagus. Feel the healing. The feeling in the upper esophagus persisted throughout the day, slowly getting better. Movement around father app and some strength training. A lot of mucus also gathered in the throat. Archived PL: Leia to nu pune mina, deleted from SSD, removed favorites. Farewell, little project. I tried. I Learned of the intimate matters of the soul. In sickness, i pondered the will of God and the universe. I have lived a beautiful life. But still, the wind tells me that there is more. For sure all this world is in God's touch , but is everything that happen God's Will? The User, Tao, whatever the name, perhaps it could give some free personal choice? But that would mean that the Mind exists alone, while it constantly co-exists with the surrounding Minds and Nature. It purely responds to it. \u2014- Homeless man Omen \u2014\u2014 Give 1 leu to each kid, then i noticed a park because of them. Did 15 pull ups, them felt amazing. So strong. Homeless man back shirt message. Get Up. Survive. Go back to Bed. The other homeless coming in mentioning the Bible. She cuts hair remaining nails as one fell in her sleep, i pack Spinu. Go Rest, my friend. It's been a long journey since that afternoon in Ludus, 2 years ago. With you i have learned to fall in love deeply with the night. But it's time we part ways for now. The Natural Truth of the body asks to be respected. Fuck StripChat - i tried Full heart - with full full belief - but it is a dead road. In just one week tasted all flavors: great money in first days beginners luck - then superstar effect in mid-week - then only dust and bitterness in the last part of the week. For sure my purpose here on Earth is not to talk to horny men nor make my little girl sell her pussy, seeing her as a Pelican sees his money-making bitch. Get angry when she not do good even tho it is my way of teaching her, just as my father teached me. It is a Fountain of Life, my friend - what you've felt from day 1. Whatever the consequences, Men shall not play with this ~ it can be only a Deal with the devil. But what if the other half of the coin is her leaving - perhaps into a life of whoring not as a play, but as a life with another man? Then so be it, my friend. My little girl shall not be stained again by these Hands. Project Liberation: Leia - The End. --- Out on the balcony with the Healer, instead of Spinu--- He also has some great words and wisdom to share. And he is just as enjoyable. Preparing marigold tea and Butterfly Pea, together with nalba and tataneasa cold tea for later - need to store in jar so nothing gets in. Buy some form of tea boiling with perfect lid. I feel there have been enough nights, my friend. Enough suffering for our sweet KS2. \"I love it when you do it\" - i hear her voice about anything related to her loving pussy - the fountain of life. It is truly a shame to exploit it in this way. And brings Soul dukkha like nothing else before - the constant exposure to that world - talking to them - preparing profile, etc. It's clear it needs to come to an end. But just as the KS2 dukkha was studied by the Mind until some some form of solution was found, like the wake-up - so had the issue of parts of Ammy needing to leave. Yes it has solved it, but at what Cost? How does it feel to work on Re-Connect or Neo, compared to PL: L ? It is not inflamation, but a clear Wound on the upper digestive tract, Esophagus. Well, truly traumatizing days for the body lately, which had spoken in constant re-occuring dreams of Ammy leaving. The emotional side is clearly weighing at least half of the KS2 health. For now, keep somewhat active the awareness of the esophagus damage. Nurture it with Breath, Movement, Water inside and outside, Tea. Barret's Eshophagus. Let's completely heal it. It's funny how the emotional eating and giving into pleasure - it's what caused it - And soon the Mind had spiraled uncontrolled in a dance in which the Dukkha is caused by over and bad eating - and the response is over-bad eating. What a vicious cycle. Let's break it. To Life. Fermentation happening in the colon seems to push out with more dukkha vapors the whole chyme & stomac acid. Burping feels liberating. Full Healing Mode On. A calling for Fasting is felt in the air. And of my healing tea, of course. Maybe 2x. Some beautiful dhamma work on Renewal History. Pretty complicated pattern, but beautiful to run."}

There is extraordinary content out there. But One Minds needs to be focused. Found some Python LLM developer roles in Thailand full Remote.

And so beings.. Project Liberation: Neo. 9.26 AM. Liberating with Truth from family beliefs - everything can be so simple. \"E prea mare durerea in sufletul ei, separated from childs.\" - you were right mom. you were right granny. If i am to try being with her, for the first time in our lifes, i have to go there with Remote or Thai job. The Third time One shall see her in Thailand, in the magical city of Surrat Thani, the meeting shall be complete. ~Just as I Write this and the Soul Liberates, get linkedin message~ How can there be anything wrong in this World? --- In the pursuit of Money, worry and keeping her with me, One had been completely strained away from his Life Purpose: Neo and Lao Complaint with life enery put into Yardi, worry, dark side, pleasures--- Of course the body will get sick. It don't matter what you eat. Everything springs from the unconciousness. A mother separated from child. A pure heart in love man wanting life with her in the impossibility of everything. Nothing else coming from more surface layers won't matter anymore. They will all reach the surface stained. It is not that she is not the one, but now it is clearly not the time. Return to your Dojo, Jedi. Neo. Return from the Dark Side of $ex and engage in true Effort and Dedication. You've wanted to achieve Dhamma Life Vision as a pimp making money of his girl selling her pussy online - well there this is the full power of the Dark Side. Strains One away from one's path, but the body speaks. The core layer is the most important of all, from it everything will manifest. Can you meet it with Faith, Wisdom and Purpose? Again, the same mother pattern bruns on the inside - of not wanting to play holiday with her - but full life. At least create the circumstances in which you can try full heart - get your little house in the woods of Thailand. ---The answers of life in the breaking of a Coconut--- Making coconut milk for the first time in my life. But it is no Thai coconut. A vision comes of making it again, together - in Thailand. My asian lady in asian kimono. The picking up of a fresh coconut from a Tree and making milk. The Dojo.. It is truly beautiful - but can you start over, once again, my friend? Can you Hold? It is clear, just as mom and granny said, there can be no separation of this woman from her children. They too, just as me, are her life. Just as now, she cannot even think of leaving, wit her baby Lao hurt. First take care make him feel good, then ponder the planning. And remember how she feels when her heart is at peace with her shildren. In the making of the coconut i see her life more than words. Truly, for the first time in our lifes, experience the chance of a life together. My full heart with her full heart. ~All is needed for this possibility is Neo Liberating. And the beautiful thing is that even if i shall not re-unite in family with Leia, is it still the Way. It opens the gate to the World. You do not love her now because she is not the woman you fell in love with, she is but a trace of Her without her shildren. I love you woman. Ammy's golden advice. If you start to be scared of what you eat, only more dukkha will come. Just eat what you want to eat. Only don't do it in excess and at night. But for this to happen, you must eat during the day. Morning meet with Spinu - Give me wisdom, my friend. Take this hand my Lao friend - great unconciousness dukkha with re-occuring dreams of Ammy leaving. Only one thing i can tell you. There is more to life than a clinging to a currently unsolvable pattern. Now, take this dukkha and pair it with excess eating for 2 weeks - especially in X pattern at night (waking up to eat) - creating constant dukkha envinronment for the dear KS2. Once this peaks, focus al the Mind's energy into the disease. Pair all of this with the already known great X pattern - which is to not Rise when the body asks to rise. Even in tiredness, find some purpose kneeling, standing, walking - i know it is no easy. But it is no easy Boss to fight. Of course the disease will grow. ---The moment you stop thinking about it, is the moment the body starts to Heal--- ~The morning roll and re-roll of spinu on the balcony's Squat~ Do your bidding. Here comes another morning. Another chance to Life. Good morning, my friend. Do your bidding here on Earth. Let Ammy leaving be just a momentary parting of souls. You don't know what awaits. From sunset to Sun-Rise, life can completely change. You can wake up one day with Remote free job and possibility to truly be with her. Together with her Atom. It is the story of the foreigner who moved to his true love family, not the other way around. The great dukkha is caused by the Mind seeing this pattern of her leaving as Final. But is it not, my friend. In her eyes it is far from it. \"I love you all my heart.. Forever.\" Break this pattern to same as before. Let the Gods decide, for now you fight for love and this world. And if the Tao has it that another woman shall cross your path, let that be. But not with stress, my friend. With no pressure - let it naturally unfold. From Both Neo and Re-Connect. You've tried full heart - the Leia project - and it has reached a clear natural end. For now, it doesn't seem her place is here. But believe. Maybe give it 1-2 weeks of playing to find another purpose&job - and then change plane ticket? The esophagus feels different tho today, together with all Kaya Sankhara 2. Not so acidic.\""}

I see my reflection around the mirrors being so skinny. The 2 bodies than coincide - intuitively i would suggest not eating anymore, but it conincides with skinny. Just few days ago, it was an absolute blessing the food - started little in the morning, with peak meal in the afternoon and slowed down again towards the evening. But i had clean air.. squatting, walking. ~Also, even tho not final, i would attribute some degree to smoking. - clearly.

Even though it does not seem like after recovering from a cold - jumping back in 100% functionality state.. But rather easing into it.. Very easing into it. Some form of stress persisted with the Mind continously giving way to some worry and feedback from body. Trying out new whole wheat crackers - their taste makes the Mind crave Assassins Creed.

A big storm is preparing, with a loud sky unheard of in many months. Take little sips of chips & riso, but the body makes an effortless choice to abandon this and go love sleep. The Mind vs The Body. Go to my Queen of the night. Oh, how her alchemy changes in rest and sleep. I wake up to the complete love of my life. ---Baby, i already know this, remember?---- The mind has computed so much about the rising dukkha with Ammy from logistics, smoking.. etc. While in her heart this has already been solved. But how much dukkha grew with each withheld thought and action. Ride together with scooter greatly triggers low back pain. Fucking logistics.. Well, that is why it's called: The Art Of Life. Must resolve car, either fix or sell & buy another. Then logistics with Ammy will somewhat free. And scooter remains for solo driving. The Tear continues, with realizing Logistics are very poor with Ammy now. Stuck in the house. Scooter is way too high G-Force level now to handle without KS3 triggering. Also scooter lights broke. Hate on Re-Connect. Body is very tired. But still, with Ammy here and Natural truths somewhat respected, there is calm. If you can keep you head when all around you are losing theirs And blaming it on you. And things take a mid-day turn, as the mind predicts some dukkha, mainly arising from her excessive smoking. And tired body perhaps, smell of artificial perfume, having to make plans and purpose for her. Is no easy thing in this alchemy & plans. Give it time. But as this storm begins, granny is also on the very edge, calling me names and disrespecting. From granny's POV, it can be looked and fed neurally the dukkha hiding POV. It seems to have infected mother too. In this midst, there is also KS3 triggered from many work did today. Many walking, standing, driving around. Eate little dhamma meal and body temp went up. Relax, my friend. Do your work here. Eat your good food. Allow the Mind to feel Piti. Allow the body to be completely free. Play with dick on the balcony. The Art of Breaking out & back in the office. So fucking smooth today. ---The re-uniting of souls--- Beyond words. Her smell. Bodies feel like 2 pieces of puzzle coming together. Body craves wash, water and food. Ecstatic eating. The clear Mind in action. Logged whole time. Prepared other projects to fire. Took upon 15 hours CPR. ---The Office Alchemist--- Learned about air comms from cleaning lady. What I could not see before, now I see them all. Alchemized the air. Body relaxed. Use glasses for PC. Adapt true dhamma positions. \"Ii buna viata nialau?\" - question arises in self-contemplation. Yes, life is amazing. Doing some dhamma yardi work. The waves of Terror from pattern analysis (log time for example) - are the Mind light-speed predicting some very deep mother_patterns. But the only mother_pattern here, beyond calculus, distribution, art of writing - these are dhammas. The wave-inducing mother_pattern is purely the fear of being questioned about it. Oh but then it is not you who will meet it, but I. You do your thing as best as you can, my friend. One thing at a time. One click. ---Once the bloodline is perpetuated in her, then your forefathers will stand by your side---- Mother. Father. Granny. Everybody in this bloodline, raising the core question to the Mind: Reproduce. In time, Love, Money. No matter your journey here on earth, they will take care of Luke and Leia. The bloodline of your mother flowing on the left side and the bloodline of the warrior flowing on the right side.. meeting as One. They have spoken. Once you Believe, you are not Alone. No more words. Words are nothing. Talking about God is just writing in the water, but I shall bring God to you, my forefathers. Many possibilities arise studying this mother_pattern, once the fog of Fear is lifted. I. She re-visits Romania as she is about to give birth so baby has romanian citizenship. II. I go marry her and we come back as family, regardless is baby is born or not (dependent on Israel & $) III. I go there when the baby is born to establish fatherhood then apply for family reunion visa. IV. Recognize fatherhood through power of attorney with her acting on my behalf, then apply for visa reunion. Apply later for romanian citizenship of baby (this is if One cannot be present, but is highly unlikely.) Beautiful analysis. More important, once your forefathers feel the perpetuation of our genes, they will stand behind you. In all regards. In all scenarios. As One. Family. Look Cosu family triggering towards perpetuation of family. It is beyond the Mind. Just like when mother aided in flight. The perpetuation of the body. Our DNA string. Millions of years old. And her DNA string. Of course, this does not mean now that this is a plan and One shall baby her as soon as possible and with clinging to the outcome. That is for the current body & mind alchemy, flowing in the Tao, to decide. But it means the mother_pattern fear of baby has been completely lifted. Free to Play. Another beautiful adaptation with car parking, adjusting as the unknown becomes the known. Walking while contemplating the core body desire when with her - putting baby inside her. The Mind is young and fears it, but the body is millions of years old and craving for it. The Forefathers realization soon comes to Mind. The Art of Driving. First learned on the bike (10kg), scooter followed many months and reflection later (100kg), then car slowly follows, the hardest of all (1tone+). G-Force in action. Good morning, my friend.

Rest and Rejuvenation: The Sabbath is seen as a day of rest, echoing the biblical creation narrative in which God rested on the seventh day. This rest is not just physical but also mental and spiritual, allowing individuals to rejuvenate themselves and honor the divine commandment. 2. Worship and Prayer: Attending religious services, participating in communal prayers, and reading from holy scriptures are key aspects of observing the Sabbath. These practices help individuals deepen their relationship with the divine and their community. 3. Reflection and Gratitude: The Sabbath encourages a time of introspection, where individuals can reflect on their lives, express gratitude for their blessings, and seek forgiveness and spiritual growth. 4. Disconnecting from Mundane Activities: Many observe the Sabbath by refraining from work and everyday activities, such as using technology or engaging in commercial transactions. This intentional pause is meant to create a space for spiritual activities and connection with loved ones. 5. Communal and Family Time: The Sabbath is often a time for gathering with family and friends, sharing meals, and fostering community bonds. This aspect emphasizes human connection and the importance of relationships. 6. Embracing Joy and Peace: The Sabbath is not just about what is refrained from but also about embracing joy, peace, and a sense of renewal. It is an opportunity to delight in life\u2019s simple pleasures, such as good food, nature, and meaningful conversation. 7. Observing Traditions: Various traditions, such as lighting candles, sharing special meals, and singing hymns, are integral to the Sabbath observance. These rituals help create a sense of sacred time and continuity with one's heritage."}

At times the alchemy of the body seems to change from recovering and relaxing to fighting the virus. But the Mind stops the thoughts at the door. No need for pattern prediction now, powerful mind. Complete trust in God. Complete trust in body. Is it not the same Force guiding it? Fully relax all muscles in comfortable position, fully allow the body to breath how it wants to breath. Fully alow it to sweat, the feeling of fighting the virus together, not a body fighting and a Mind stressing. I will never disrespect the greatness of the Medicine world. It has saved my life. When there is no need for deep relaxation & fighting - engage the Mind in chess or other relaxing immersive actions. Contemplating about deep, core life changes. Life-Creating Energy.

Shedding light: The semi-moon spins the engine and turns the piston inside the cylinder (compression, fuel, spark) Opening the throttle slightly when kickstarting can help introduce more air and fuel into the combustion chamber, making it easier for the engine to start. However, too much throttle can flood the engine, making it more difficult to start. Examine the Ignition System: Remove and inspect the spark plug. Clean or replace it if necessary. Check the ignition coil and wiring for any signs of wear or damage. Test for Compression: Perform a compression test to ensure the engine has adequate compression. If the compression is low, it may indicate internal engine issues that need to be addressed. Fails, Overwhelming - or lessons in Adaptation?

It might not even be that much antibiotics effect as it is G force patterns changing. Complete, complete changing. Unlike motorcycle accident, this heavy- heavy - heavy weakened the body - from all angles - while heavy G force patterns arised, giving rise in day 5-6 to back pain. Also pelvic inflamation played a huge role. Haven\u2019t written on phone diary in a long time. Remember, my friend, just years ago this pain was constant and deeply affecting the quality of life.

In what is greater than us. Then life and death. Let the teachings of the Eastern World now come into play, separating Mind from Body. Fully allowing 0 G-force so it can heal. The spontaneous regressions still remain a mystery. They appear to happen uncontrollably under movement. When they need to happen. But the Mind cannot control. But what is certain - there are some Y patterns. The True art of Adapting. Well now in sickness, my friend, you can study the true Art of Adapting. When dhamma activities are vastly shrinked by disease. How well do you adapt? Can you carve the best Y pattern you can think of - then Fully believe ? You are, after all - in a God-made body. A miracle of nature. Breath. Dont predict anything mind. Just remain here. Apt seems another form of Y pattern - itchy inducing. What is clear - is that is a true dance with G force. Continuous. Thoughts of whole life being like this is a thought of an untrained mind. An undisciplined mind. I will try everyday until the day i die. I have my family. I have my God. Everything else is adapting so well until One finds Falling in Love with Life. ~the Trade-off off redemption. Yes, its a clear prediction back will worsen if i help granny, but it feels like a forgiveness for the sufferings i had caused her too. Long working, intense day. Set up curtain. Now, kneeling position allows full writing. All in all, this stomach has never felt better. Air doesn't seem so polluted anymore, sun so burning, wind&screen so disturbing - Extraordinarily. You see, my friend - it is very possible that the chronic stomach caused the Immune System to go down. Some things are vastly clear. There is a Body and some Natural truths these body bows to - more so - its binded by them. - Forming the Alchemy of the Body. (The Father) There is a Mind, the a vast, complex dataset of knowledge and experience it has been exposed too. - Forming the Alchemy of the Mind. (The Son) And there is a Force guiding everything - beyond the Mind. It falls outside the scope of the mind to completely grasp it, but it can read it through the Language of the World and Body. (The Holy Spirit) The Body thrives in health and High Frequencies of existance when the Natural Truths are respected. The Mind thrives when performing succesful readings & tasks towards this (Nurturing the Violin) and deeper succesful tasks (puporse on this Earth, creating, Healing, Helping, Giving, Learning) The Mind has the power to bend these Natural Truths to it's likings, will and purpose. - based on the dataset. But there are some Ancient Teachings - Teachings which meet profound life experiences when studied closely, and science - and the Religion which paints them best is Christianity. God. When they become deeply rooted in the Mind - it unleashes it's power for good. When the Mind drifts away from these teachings - the body gets sick. Even if he Mind sees it, if the core-low level of life is not strongly rooted - it cannot overcome body & Mind pleasures which further sicken. Body still deals in Air, Food, Water and ~Feelings. Mind still deals in generating thoughts based on these readings and further feeding it to itself, generating more feelings while continuing to read output of the body & world. Which path it takes? Now that will be guided by the Soul and the Natural Truths. But one thing is Clear - is that even the Natural Truths bend in front of The Spark of Life, Syncronicithies, God. For the Mind can paint many stories of what just had saved its life, but one things is clear. It was Out of it's Control. Believe in ~feelings, not Understanding. Now One could ponder inifinitely about the Nature of Reality. Is History Real? Is Time Real? Is there Free Will? ~Omen flies Are there Angels & Demons? What is next dimension after God's realm? The Mind cannot comprehend stopping. It longs for more and more, for deeper and deeper understanding - using the same Laws of Existance read from body's senses - Space, Feeling, Gravity, Entropy. If my father had time with me in childhood for homework and love - was there a school and life choice which could have been different? Where is the Free Choice then? Free will? There was none back there, for the Mind was still ~Sleeping and the body ~Enclosed. Well, not at that time - as it first requires Liberation of the ~Body and ~Mind. And as soon as One Awakens to this World - learning from experience the Alchemy of the 10 commendments, 7 sins, ever-changing alchemy, their binding to the Natural Truths and of this Beautiful, Beautiful world - One has a Choice. In that moment of choosing when to stop eating - in that moment of fight with someone - in that moment of Greed, Envy, Lust -a trained Mind will be able to see the unfoldings - predict - and stop the neural activation right there. Mind guiding the Body, not the other way around. Conciousness. This appears to be the ultimate purpose of Conciousness. Heal this body contiously - Heal this World contionously. Use the Ancient Knowledges to do so. Not out of Fear of Death and Judgement Day - but out of Effortless Experience. Just as the squat down after a meal. Then the \"I\" puporse is complete. The System enters a continous state, non-consuming of Falling in Love With Life. The thousands of Falling in love with life open the gateway to the Falling Out of Love with Life - for one cannot be without the other. Is God playing itself, as the Eastern World claims? Is it all a simulation for the MInd (Conciousness) ? Then is God the creator, testing software - with an upcoming judgement day? This immediately rises the next question of what is the next dimension, where is the Creator world begin and end? Reaching once again, a limitation of the Mind comprehension. The body, with Nature - is the closest gateway to this world. And it continously speaks. Is it well fed? Well Rested? Breathing good, calm air? Are there good feelings cultivated and bad ones stopped at the door? Is the Mind continously learning of this world? Improving? Can it discern the Natural Truths of this World? Can it discern what are Mind-Induced Truths? Can it ~Feel what is the Language of the World and God? Whatever people call It around the world - it is Sacred. It speaks in Love, Humbleness, lack of Gluttony, Greed, Lust, Pride, Sloth, Wrath and Envy. It speaks in complete belief in it beyond the Stories of the Mind - in respecting it full-hearteadly without naming other combinations of commendments & sins as The One. - In Speaking the truth, not stealing nor hurting, nor cultivating new darker alchemies. (lying, cheating, stealing, longing from envy). Life, on a conciousness level - it is a binding of Life-Creating Energy, Life-Sustaining Energy and the Envinronment. Cherish them at any cost. ~Language of the World - Omens and Syncronicithies. Mind cannot understand them, just as God or the body functions and immune systems fully - it can purely read and take Guidance from them - based on feelings. But one thing it should never forget - it was first the Body, the World - then the Mind came on top of it. The Violin & Violonist. And the Universe playing it's continous changing Music. God's Music. ~Since the Mind, disconnected from senses - can only ponder Mind-Induced Truths Do not practice, pray, believe out of fear, my son. Let the 10 commendments and 7 sins be treasured lessons of the past, rather than forced rituals done of out Fear. If there is one thing for sure - is it the Frequency of Fear - and how it Drives one to suffering. Uncontrollable dream of killing Oszkar and just the \"joy\" of killing - some unconciousness forces while the conciousness is sleeping. God protect me from these demons which walk this earth.

No need for childish ultimatums. The story can be just as well as she going to work in Samui, while still a strong sense of togetherness remains. She asked me to promise i will incinerate her body and release it into the water if she dies before me. And made dreams about our little house and garden.. and chickens. Let's see what you got prepared, old King. The concentrated Mind, as Bhikku calls it. When the Mind has stableness (samahito), Pureness (parusuddho) and activeness(kammaniyo) - clear Mind arises. It can study any problem which arises, scrutnitize it with every breath in and out, until it raches Resolution. That is why leaving now or in 1.5 months is the same. More so, it's a better envinronment for Project Liberation: Neo. ~Taking the Darkest fear and Alchimizing it~ This thought, however pure flowing from One's heart, is instantly met by the mother_pattern of family disbelief reconfirming in them. I have no doubt in my heart, but their feel to fill with darkness. Giving way to more darkness. But time for words is long gone, my friend. Walk your path, whether it may take 2 years, if you truly feel to family this woman and the old King has this planned, But is it all Written? - coming with the great Liberation of the mind to Free to Play. Or there is some free choice and will and influence on One's destiny. Well, the body is certainly part of nature and the force making everything flow. And the body continuously in aliveness alchemizes the Mind. They are One. But there is left the deeper layer of the soul - is there someone else behind the wheel, Making it so that when one heart is settled, the mind and body get re-written? Or is it just a truly deep, powerful, nerual activation? Well it comes from the contact with the outer world - the epiphanies of Life. So data would point out that there is no shadowed \"I\" at the wheel, just the beautiful created universe and a body and mind - far from free will but deeply(entirely) influenced by Nature's demand for survival - adapting from generation to generation. Well, that's if the past is \"real\" and it is not all a simulation. You don't know. But the body can feel no fear towards death. It has played it's part in the world of men, striving to the best and flawlessly as it could. The Mind too, it has found the body and awakened all senses, seeing this world as beautiful as it truly is. The User, if there is One, is playing a beautiful game.

The Body.. trains and pumps for the first time in a long time. The heart feel more liberated. Playing some relaxed CQ. Analyzing the surrounding dhammas. Talk with my friend MeekoZo. Beautiful evening. I could eat or not eat, while hunting here so relaxed with Lao - it's a free choice. \"I\" clinge to none, but It's late, but i feel the stomach is empty now and left with moderate acid levels - a little food could help the acidicity. But corn flakes cereals would be too much now. I find fresh cooked corn from Ammy. Eate 1, then another one. I think she put sugar on them. The finishing of second one instantly disturbs KS2. So i cannot sleep in this alchemy, it would be too disturbing for KS2. Go back computer and study Einstein. And in this high frequency Alchemy.. everything turns to a laughable game. Her complete peak of dukkha and suffering is met with true dhamma and enjoyment of life. She cries.. and i laugh - for it is such a beautiful thing to experience.. Life with all it's drama. Perhaps her karmic balance loaded up negatively in the World she played. Perhaps she needs Redemption and needs it alone. Let's see. Beautiful video on the balcony's rain. Nature is washing away all the sins of the past. Cleansing. There is extraordinarily content about her early departure. 7pm with Spinu on the balcony. A beautiful, yet restless and clouded evening. Very troublesome situation with Ammy being sick with serious & complicated symptoms. With no medical insurance. This plays another huge, huge part in the backing home. Maybe even final. The Wind answers. 27th august or 3 Sept. I really don't know. I could play the selfless card and choose 27th august. Or the i've been more than half selfless and play 3th. I Ponder a coinflip. The Wind answers again. I think 3 its enough - it's half-half. Yet Nature speaks.. and she speaks. And there is patience from Zhou. Let's see what the dreams have to speak about this. Without clinging. And the morning shall come with light. JLL cake comes back again.. \"We are 5 steps back from previous versions\" - oh how much you like to drama. I have done nothing but make your will, attested by unit testing documents at each delivery on your data. This builds up with Time Logging and Case. Let's address those first. It is an un-perceivable mountains to fix everything at once. Only step by step can one walk. There is a scent in the air, despite all the issues and money, honey, ammy, future - The scent is: Life is Extraordinarily beautiful. In a body slowly closing back to Heallth, brick by brick, night by night avoiding excess, WIth a Clear, Concentrated, Liberated Mind - it all begins once again to feel like a game, eager to play. The highest dukkha activated pattern about Ammy going back earlier is the dukkha and disbelief of my mother and granny. For them to understand would mean for them to experience life through my lenses - to understand what it truly means to Believe and live in the present. You know this cannot be.. they have lived their own individual lifes. A short way to end the pattern would be \"Mother you were right.\" - but this is so far from the truth. I never expected Ammy to choose me over her kids. I would not love her and want to mommy her if she did. ---Back to before KS2 peak--- Today i eate some easy meal in the morning, corn flakes with some plant milk and coconut. 1 week ago, in peak moment, this was extremely triggering. But now.. it was pretty good. I could have eaten more. Go for afternoon ride & walk - then eate some potatoes with cheese ammy had cooked - and after a riso + more than half chips bag. But i can lay back on chair and rest after.. it's been a long time since this. Fall asleep 2 hours.. Oh my sweet afternoon summer dhamma pattern. Wake up - Rise the firewall to prevent eating upon wake up - but Drink water and wash tooth. Do some little work around. Walk the yard. Good morning, my friend. Wake up 4am, not even get outside. Some little sick, but purely studying data - a body waking up going straight to computer study for hours - indicates that the body is, on a larger scale, healing. Ammy comes to concious world where the Mind meets extraordinary pain inputs from the body. Instantly burst in a pain crisis. Get's up. Her right upper part of stomach feels very sensible and reacting to touch. The lack of Medical Insurance deeply complicates things. Let's see. It would be ideal to keep the body in the most cleanest of Alchemy. From Air - to Food - to Movemement - to Feeling. But also i must give it to them.. the medical world is extraordinarily amazing. But it remains simply a tool, far from the God-Given power the modern man gives it, and what's actually the culprit, the surrendering of all One's duties towards Health to it, as a cult. Beyond this concept, it is truly, truly amazing. Just as Voyager 2 trajectory was calculated at seconds and meters, in sync with the other celestial bodies - painting the picture of absolute peak in the Mind & Body's development. - just as has the medical world expanded beyond imagination."}

Still, the system is left hungry and in pelvic pain - and cannot fully lay & rest in this alchemy. Had idea to try old eating position in back laying - but still there is tension felt - body is in pain and Mind is managing the best it can.

So eat again around 10, although not a big meal now - medium one (but with littlr sugary whole wheat flakes) This meets on top of the previous meal - entering a system in already a passed Hara Hachi Bu.

{"prompt": "What truths lie beyond the stories we tell ourselves?", "content": "A conversation between the Student and the Master: Ponderings of Centuries The Student's Perspective Pattern of Predictions: The student describes feeling trapped in a loop of mental predictions, which were triggered by anticipating an event (waking up early for an in-game battle). They became absorbed in a story created by their mind, detached from their body's actual sensations and feelings. This pattern of \u201cpredicting\u201d is a repeated, self-critical inner dialogue questioning their progress and worth. Realization of the Pattern: The student recognizes the \"predicting\" tendency as a mental habit. Each time they catch themselves, they feel momentary relief or \"liberation\" but quickly fall into another prediction. This cycle repeats itself, even after reading about a friend\u2019s condition (the concept of \u201cBubu\u201d), where they begin to worry and create another story based on assumptions. Seeking Truth Outside Prediction: Rather than act on predictions about their friend\u2019s wellbeing, the student directly asks about their friend\u2019s state, breaking the prediction cycle and finding relief in actual facts rather than assumptions. The Master's Perspective Warnings about Predictions: The master warns that when a person is in \u201clow alchemy\u201d (likely a low or imbalanced mental or emotional state), predictions can lead to fear and suffering. Feeding these fears only makes them grow. In mindfulness, they advise being aware that predictions and assumptions are stories\u2014not reality. Stories vs. Truth: The master suggests that any interpretations the student attaches to experiences (like reading about \u201cBubu\u201d) are creations of the mind, calling them \"drama.\" They differentiate \"natural truths\" (like a disturbed sleep or environmental conditions) from \"stories\"\u2014the emotional labels or narratives the mind adds, which turn into serious, \"dramatic\" interpretations. Perspective on \"Natural Truths\": They emphasize the difference between raw experiences (like movement, sunlight, enclosed spaces) and the mind\u2019s stories, which can skew the experience based on one\u2019s mental state or \u201calchemy.\u201d In a healthier state of mind, the student might interpret the same reading (about \u201cBubu\u201d) differently, seeing it as beautiful rather than distressing. On Perspective and \"I\": The master explains that the \u201cI\u201d or ego can distort perception, turning simple experiences into dramatic, self-centered stories. When deeply immersed in the mind\u2019s creation, one no longer sees or hears things as they are; instead, experiences are filtered through personal fears and beliefs. Summary The conversation highlights a practice in mindfulness: separating \u201cnatural truths\u201d (observable facts) from \u201cstories\u201d (the mind\u2019s emotional interpretations). The master encourages awareness of how easily the mind can turn facts into predictions and drama, particularly when one is feeling low. They suggest a continuous, mindful detachment from these stories to prevent sufferingg. Well then, who is this Mind in all this? Well it was momentarily the \u201cMaster\u201d, as the Master was needed. But it quickly returned to no-clinging. Just seconds later, it can immerse in the student role, for the student\u2019s patterns are deeply familiar. Or step in none of the characters and simply watch the \u201cmovie\u201d. The \u201cMaster\u201d had risen from water and back into water as he was no longer needed. The beautiful, connected birthings of \u201cI\u201d. The only difference is that the yet un-awakened student cannot detached from the \u201cI\u201d. For this Mind, the conversation has far drifted from Lao and PonPon. Looking across centuries, the same conversation had happened before between many Masters and Students - as the bodies and Minds took the different roles across lifetimes. Let the Master be the Master. The Student to be the Student. Wind to be wind and sun to be Sun. There is no need in attachment of the \u201cI\u201d to any of those.

{"prompt": "Imagine a world where food unites souls across time.", "content": "--- Old and New Testament view on Food & Meat --- The Shift from Natural world to the Soul. Wouldn't it be better a binding of the 2? Re-Connect. Old Testament: Kosher Laws and Meat Restrictions In the Old Testament, the dietary laws given by God, particularly in Leviticus and Deuteronomy, were very specific about what kinds of meat were permissible for the Israelites to eat. These laws were part of the larger system of kashrut (kosher) that outlined clean and unclean animals: Clean animals: Land animals with cloven hooves that chew cud (e.g., cattle, sheep, goats), certain birds, and fish with fins and scales. Unclean animals: Pigs, shellfish, certain birds (e.g., eagles, owls), and animals that don\u2019t fit the criteria for clean. These laws had a deep symbolic meaning for the Israelites, representing purity, separation from pagan practices, and obedience to God. They were more than just dietary preferences; they were an expression of the covenant relationship between God and His people. For instance, in Leviticus 11, God lays out which animals are clean and unclean, and this would have been seen not merely as a health guideline but as a way of maintaining ritual purity. Following these laws was a form of worship, a way to live according to God\u2019s order. Transition with Jesus and the New Testament Fast forward to the New Testament and the coming of Jesus Christ. As Christianity emerged from Judaism, a new interpretation of the old laws began to form. The focus shifted from external rituals and symbols to internal purity and spiritual intent. Jesus himself said in the Gospel of Matthew: \"It\u2019s not what goes into your mouth that defiles you; you are defiled by the words that come out of your mouth.\" (Matthew 15:11) This was revolutionary because it shifted the emphasis from ritual dietary restrictions to the condition of the heart and mind. The idea here is that what matters most is not external observance of laws but the spirit in which one lives and acts. The Vision of Peter and Lifting of Food Laws One of the most significant moments related to the lifting of food laws comes in the Book of Acts. The Apostle Peter had a vision in which he saw all kinds of animals, both clean and unclean, and God said to him: \"Do not call anything impure that God has made clean.\" (Acts 10:15) This vision was a key turning point, symbolizing not just the lifting of dietary restrictions but also the inclusion of Gentiles (non-Jews) into the early Christian faith. The early church, especially after this vision, began to move away from the strict kosher laws and embraced a more inclusive view of eating. In Paul's letters, this is expanded even further. For example, in 1 Corinthians, Paul writes about eating meat sacrificed to idols, suggesting that Christians are free to eat anything, provided it does not cause another believer to stumble in their faith: \"So whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God.\" (1 Corinthians 10:31) This represents a complete shift away from the Old Testament\u2019s detailed food laws."}

Well not a girl to marry or mother, at least from previous pattern analysis of these ramifications on girls.. but a hot girl to give way into knowing, if the Old King shall allow. A beastly, animalic, ecstatic Call of the Body to Mate when her presence enters through the sense of sight and further painted in the mind. In her presence, smell and sexual energy, the Mind & Body could completely immerse in the sexual energy, with complete de-focusing of others. The great energy of life, my friend. Yes, it is highly limited in this env, but you don't know what the Old Carpenter had prepared there. So just give way to it when it arises naturally, without forcing it. But know these sexual Goddesses usually do not posses many of the qualities we, together and aiming towards family, would look for.

{"prompt": "What whispers does the soul share beyond words?", "content": "----The Easter Night Omen---- ~Play Krypton - Iti mai aduci aminte~ 2am. And so, awakened from a dark dream in a heavy-ish and inflamed body state, i rise and go to church. I do not know who's taking me, why i'm taking certain paths why i'm chossing this specific parking spot for bike and finding a spot to watch. But not long into the church yard - i see Her. Is it truly her or a dellusion of the MInd? It was not long ago since i saw her in every blonde haired woman coming in my path, why would it be different now? But it is. Barbosule..... cum le asezi. Everything is connected. Omen. Her nose is changed yet it still bears the unique flavor of her. I see her beyond any looks, just as my mother and Ammy see me. The conversation flew naturally. A beautiful shining ring on her finger. When i touch it, the first thought her mind runs is how uncomfortable she is wearing it, taking it off everyday when she gets home. Is this not a blunt expression of the mind&soul - portraying she is marrying for the outer eyes? Beyond words, her body speaks. The ring feels more like shackles than God's mystical touch in uniting her with another Man. I touch upon her obvious reaction, but the Mind is too parted away from the Soul. \"Nu stiu dastea....\" - she attempts putting it into words. If only.. If only i could talk to you Soul to Soul - then you would know. But i cannot. The Mind is far more concerned and computing about the \"right way\" to live, fears, parents echoes, no other easy paths to take - Than of the matters of the Heart. In her smile i find doubt regarding Ammy. Not in a way which makes me love Ammy less, but in a way that i'd be just as content to unfold a life with Her. But beyond this, beyond the selfish patterns of the Mind, i'd still wish she'd taste true love - that love which turns the souls-binding ring from uncomfortable to un-breathable. The feeling of not being able to breath or leave home without the ring - for One would feel that a part of his heart is left back. Everytime i feel someone giving up true love, it breaks my heart. Everyone around me does so, giving up true love - from mother, father, friends, Her - The Fears of the mind are greater than the call of the heart. Of couse her body-breath is affected and struggling to find an answer. If there is one thing learned from my journeys and intimate studied across years, is that the breath is the first reflection of the Mind, Body and Soul. Body conditioner - the eastern world called it. It continously reflects the well-being of the system. I'd be surprised if she'd find resolve in typical medical approach, which splits the breath as a Separate mechanicam which is to be treated individually. Scene ends with her parents and her switching around the body of Christ around them, wanting to share the extra one with me. I don't know how it rippled to this, but eventually she hands me her cup with both hands. It is still warm. I take it and i'm more absorbed by it's warmth than looking after her. Man, it's the first time i did not check her body as she walked away.. haha. I smile.. and in the midst of hundreds of people walking around with candles, everything feels connected. Not even a flap of the wings of a fly is misplaced. ~Iti mai aduci aminte drumul spre nori?~ 5am. ~The Letters of the Past~ Last month i kept pospotning going through father letters to mother, waiting for the right moment. Everything else i enjoyed & sorted before. But the dusty letters were waiting. What better night to open the gateway to past than this holy Night ? A glimpse into the very place from where \"I\" came from. It's both heartbreaking and joyful, a Tear and a Smile. What a love story. Beyond words, into the very choosing of paper, and words, and the inter-changing pressure of pen as it continously paints the inside - how deeply he loves her. \"De ce trebuie ca altii sa risipeasca fara rost zile intregi complancandu-se intr-o stare letargica nebainuind macar ca a iubi cu adevarat e singurul rost pentru care am fost creati?\" Oh dad.. magical words. Magical Love. God-given and man-destroyed. How could the demons of fears, money and sex ever make you forget this ? The same heartbreaking question rises.. If only.. If only i could ever speak to you Soul to Soul - then you would understand. You would remember it was not money, or power, or any other woman - keeping you warm in the cold fields of war - but it was love. How you painted the tremblind soldiers scene, shaking in face of cold, death and fear - but one of them was smiling - for he was touched by Love. And it overcame everything else. True Love."}

Body immediately reacted and threw her off. Hate floods the system as the little creature had attacked him. But there is the Mind. It sees the greater things. It sees beyond the hatred. Love. And fascination as the body's immune system immediately reacts to the pinch. Mind aids with knowledge, by squeezing and pushing out any outer germs which her bite might her carried. Together.

Now she spent the last half hour climbing the window. She is relaxed. Just before writing these lines, the Mind - in Some awareness of all the system, the Natural Truths and the Secrets of Life, Has pondered - Why did \"I\" arise here? I can see everything. I can change the world, carve together or against the envinronment with these 2 hands. A complete master of the envinronment. Whatever evolved being one might imagine, a Mind in complete awareness of all the system, happenings, conditionings, Natural truths - is an extraordinarily advanced being. This body.. Magic. The Mind.. a Creator of Worlds. The sole purpose seems to be to Create Worlds - and enjoy them. But to enjoy one must partake in both tears and smiles. Then it is complete. Only then the power of true love arises, Alchemizing evil to love. Disbelief in faith. Pain to hunger for knowledge. Fails to treasured lessons. Once the Natural truths are alchemized, The next layer follows. Which appears to be answering to the question of \"What is the meaning of Life?\" Just in sync, there is Ammy. In complete abandonment of Natural Truths, in the center of Istanbul Airport - one of the darkest places i've ever been to. Cold. Greed. Many People with fresh hair implanted, giving sickness vibe. HIgh prices, hard floor, many people, many lights, enclosed air. Everything is against the Natural Truths of Life. In this Alchemy, even her love for me cannot be enjoyed and the re-uniting of souls. But love still burns. It seems it can never be completely quinched. But the Natural truths are fuel for this candle. They fuel Love. Love for this Creation. In all forms, shapes, flavors. The true Art of Movement lies in the catching of flies without harming them, Mopping the ants without hurting them, Cleaning with true fascination and exploration of new, fun patterns, Riding in complete sync with the inter-changing G-Forces. The Art of Movement.

Free. Water. Flowing. Contionusly changing, adapting, taking the form of the present moment vase. Bean bags, desks, tables.. plants, laptop, pc.. everything is Water. 7pm. 12 hours later, back to balcony with the avocado smoothie. It taste absolutely Healing. Did a lot today. Ordered curtains. Some little work. Admin call with Pelicanu. It's clear that i need to re-factor Dojo so that it allows big room Webinar. The Metal factory felt like a movie-scene. The eastern people working in harsh environment for little money. Again used sleep cheat codes, the sweet sleep when the Mind has do to something. Amazing. It must be because the Mind & body love to be liberated. That moment comes down to plans of the mind in front of needs of the body. The materials are ready. If One is to hold multiple live's, it clearly needs computer in the big room. Option, of course, not ultimatum. For this, consider minimum adjustable desk height. H = 60 My love is in the dark Istanbul airport. I feel you, my love. I will bring sacrifice of holding masturbation and eating. The Mind is free from everything. Just work. And when get tired of working, go buy metal. Good morning from the monastery. Its so quiet here in the morning. A gentle rain sings the morning sony as it falls down and meets the leafs of the high forest trees. Riding towards the monastery & around - the sound of the enginei running smoothly in the clean air. Same Alchemy as the plane my love is in. As the body quiets down, light shines upon Ammy. She is the love of my life. No other woman ever slightly come near what I feel for her. Her stupid and dukkha, comes together with her smile and love. It's her life story. Come home, my love. Maybe even with the baby it's the same thing. Believe, even when you don't understand - even when One is afraid to believe. Like with money expeeriences & trust, ringing the bell before the sell in Re-Connect. Curtains prove a little more difficult as the bamboo ones might not have paper sheets and might allow too much sun. Let's order and return if don't like.\""}

Still, because of the dhamma food and very possibly no milk - body was filled with energy rather than lethargy. Cleaned kitchen, worked around the Dojo for a while. Wash teeth as first sign of inflamation. Beautiful. Fall asleep on the chair but in the same way, the body wakes up around 12 am and devours some fists of milk & cereal. Well, just as the other days, the night was not truly met - persisting beyond Hara Hachi Bu even in dhamma food. Body falls asleep on chair with no leg support and numbs. Wakes up with: familiar pattern of excess mea wake-up, body slight numbess&pain triggering, phase 1 of Digestive System in full unfolding with great gastric acid - immediately turns to calming food - but also throughout the day energy need might nogt have been satisfied with the light Buddha bowls. But man they felt nourishing. Creating something new, atsty, variety in every meal. Good evening, my friend. A relaxing day, not done much Yardi work. As night comes, the Mind reflects on what little victories it has achieved today. Installed & tested curtains - made return. Need to order others. ---The magic of Movement--- Again, as 4-5 pm came, i take my scooter. Ride grigo offroad - push the bike upwards - a brother helps and pushes hard. Walk in cora, move around just for the sake of moving with light purposes. Body recovers, from KS to dick irritation, to all systems - all Recovers. This body truly is like a perpetual engine which recovers in Motion. Logging some time, this week left. First review needed time, emails to know what available project, estimate total hours - then split. Bring Light. Projects: NL Rent Roll (~8 hours), eDocs (~5 hours), P3 (~4 hours) Good morning from the balcony at 10 am, my friend. ~I Did it my way~ Real life is different than planned - especially at ~9am sun strikes from above the curtain support and neighbour wall - exactly in my eyes. Also, left side was a problem - beautifuly covered left side with Granny suggested curtain. With moving the laptop position to left, i am able to serve my liffle coffee here. Again, the Dojo's quality to Be Water and continously adapt. Some immediate body responses in new position. Slowly, my friend. Left side seems more active then on the other position. But all in all, what a wonder - my friend - to carve this world to One's Will. Towards a simple purpose.. to have coffee at 10am. ~Slight degrees turn of chair towards the right and body tensions completely change."}

Love of my life is waiting in the bed, sleeping. A new Day. KS2 wakes me up at 3am. A big, powerful mooon on the sky. As Mind comes back to conciousness, everything inside burns. Acidicity rises. The great mistake - of laying down and not rising the body. Do rise after some time - but no feel nor ingredients for cook. As dukkha grows in stomach, the Mind follows. Picturing money, predicting, picturing course and it feeling incomplete, number of clients and approach.. and on and on. Picturing Neo's joruney and overwheming projects. Sweet Mind, rather then predict worries - Do your bidding. Evening cook pasta with vegetables with ammy - but pretty heavy. Went for a evening walk - it is soso do-able with mask. Back home and fall asleep on the chair - wake up with numb leg from standard position - and the conditioning was already set to eat. Eat some little chocolate with milk then lidl chocolate. In that semi-asleep state with the body also craving for food after a long, hard-working day.. the body just eats. I love this woman all my heart. Her little girl face & eyes is filling my heart with love. I love her beyond words and senses. Everything that she is, comes together with her life story. The father promise and the absolute dedication to it. The whip is funny for me, but for her it echoes the Canada memories of pain. Second Call Kathy so so - she still seeks on the outside. Third call in complete honesty with Bucuresti car dealer. Forth call with Cosu friend asking for advice i wish i had. What a weekend. --Ringing the first Re-Connect Bell-- Call with George. What an amazingly mirroring life story. Then told father.. quietness fell. Demons of greed & envy - or blinded by their own stories? Either way, it was complete quiet after i rang the bell of victories. \"Should we take the watermelon in the fridge so it won't spoil?\" My sweet ammy also was flooded with their sufferings. The Chakras my friend.. The energy Flowing. I can feel it all. Un-veiling the Secrets of the Chakras. The Heart and Soul - firm faith in dhamma, the unfolding of things, the relationship. The KS2 will react to the external outputs processed by the Mind. But, if the Soul stands un-shaken, the energy stops there. Of course.. once again.. this all comes to down to the Natural Truths. Learn them in Anapanasati. Every flavor studied, every pattern of the Mind - with every breath in and out. These are the first steps. Only after walking them One can move to the deeper aspects of his Personal Legend. Here, One takes what he had learned from studying the Natural Truths, the same techniques, and uses the same system to study the Mind. The truths of the Mind in accordance to one's Personal Legend. The Master's Work. The Alchemists. Respect them.. and the Secrets of Life will unfold. It makes One wonder though, how could religions completely ignored these Natural Truths in their teachings? Well.. they came naturally. No pollution & abundance of nature, Great, beautiful food eaten in community - and Movement - Labor, Fighting, Learning. Just as the Mind separated from the soul, it appears the Man had also separated from the Natural World. In dukkha air, heavy stomach and sedentarism - it is completely futile for One to reflect on God. --The bodies beautifully, tremendously beautifully speak continously-- It is not about controlling it, but rather seeing what everything Originates from. And, if needed, enter Developer mode and update versioning. Like the program used now with her, about the fears originating in the stomach and rising to head - if the heart (Soul) is not strong enough, un-shaken in faith. Good morning, my friend. A quiet, gentle rainy morning. The birds are singing among with the cats perfect movement. A True Art. ~Dojo \"Therapy\"~ The Fear of Failure, of doing wrong to me, the 15 years written programming. It feels like using the Art of Bodies & Words - One can connect to her even to the most deep parts of the mind & soul - but it is done beyond words. Because she does not understand in words, but experiences. It's impossible for an un-awakened mind to grasp what you're teaching. The Dojo whiteboard moment, absolute funny or heart-shattering as her reaction predicts little chance of change? It's all in how you think. In a body close to 100% functionality - the Mind becomes Free to Play. Just like turning an dark powerful emotion into physical training, so can i turn a dukkha feeling & predictions into funny. How she mowed :))))). Everything Originates in the Mind. The past reflections slowly rise about the togetherness. It is.. once again.. a true Art."}

Also to be highly considered the Low back and stomach bloating role in pee pee sensibility. All 3 seem so extraordinarily highly connected. Just as in any other dukkha, deeply study X and Y patterns and their coming together. As it triggers, talking becomes more sensible - and there rises a very fine line between light activation and recovery and doing too much. This makes it more related to low back rather than pee pee - and to the great deep psaos. This would make it co-related with the too much pressed X-Patterns in the morning of working & moving the mirror. But still it's interesting it's coming with pee pee sensations. There feels to be no separation between the system. Cannot take out one and feel the other - they co-exist.

{"prompt": "Imagine a world where warmth conquers all cold challenges.", "content": "--Morpheus gives great objective clear insight on KS.PP beyond the Stories of The Mind-- After infection area is left hypersensible. Greatly reacts to cold, needs caressed healing time. Body Sensitivity and Cold Exposure: Post-Infection Sensitivity: The bladder and genital area become inflamed due to cold air currents after a urinary infection, likely due to nerve sensitivity and reduced blood flow caused by cold exposure. Nerve Irritation: Cold air irritates already inflamed tissues, triggering muscle contraction and exacerbating discomfort. Tight Clothing: Tight pants or pressure on the genital area further aggravates sensitivity, but primarily after cold exposure has already caused irritation. Foot Warmth Connection: Cold feet play a significant role in overall body temperature regulation, and keeping feet warm helps reduce cold-induced sensitivity elsewhere. Air Current Flow in a House: Cold Air Behavior: Cold air sinks, forming drafts near the floor and moving based on pressure differences caused by open or closed windows and doors. Window and Door Management: Open windows can create air currents that increase the exposure of sensitive areas to cold air, particularly in lower parts of the house where cold air pools. Strategies for Reducing Cold Exposure: Layering Loose Clothing: Wearing loose but layered clothing, with materials like wool or thermal fabrics, helps insulate without causing additional pressure or discomfort. Environmental Control: Sealing gaps in doors and windows, using strategic ventilation, and warming specific areas with heating pads or hot water bottles can reduce cold exposure. Knowledge Needed to Put into Action: Thermal Insulation: Identifying the best materials for base layers that are both loose and insulating. Learning more about managing air currents by using window placements and drafts strategically. Body Warmth Management: More insight into how overall body temperature and specific areas (like feet and core) can influence sensitivity. Understanding the role of heating techniques such as foot baths or hot water bottles in reducing overall sensitivity. House Environment Control: More details on how to optimize airflow and warmth within different rooms, and the impact of furniture or room arrangement on air currents. Takeaways: Thermal clothing, mini heater, heating pads, warm foot baths, warm baths Prioritize this, beyond back and stomach stuff - always keep warm, keep loose, keep caressed. Alow it to heal - it is a true hard hand of nature to play as in temperature dropping so much. Adapt.

{"prompt": "What if the body could speak its true needs?", "content": "3 Holy things must be considered which are now met by fears. Fasting (giving the stomach a break in the last part of the day) - met now by being seen skinny by family and giving way to what is, in this Alchemy, excess eating. Leave the skinny concepts at the door. Let the body be skinny if it FEELS to be skinny. Go back to ~Feeling. Allow the system to relax and reset based on feeling. Aid it with clean air, movement, resting, deep breathing. Fear of not sleeping, being skinny, being weak, causing immune system down - From here rises the eating out of Fear. And it is instantly blinding. once again, my sweet Mind, don't force the body - only bad things happen. Go back to ~Feeling. Eat purely based on feeling. Eat with God* -> Wisdom* -> Purpose*. Rise regardless of hour and sleep & Not eating in the evening and night - Rise, water, do your work, dress & walk, clean, cook - and sleep when sleep comes only. - only water and at high peak 1-2 bites of food. If there is death to come, let it come on an empty, nourished stomach. Then it will be peaceful. Everything else, leave at the door. Believe. Respect the Holy Bread. Eat in humbleness and stopping the Mind's fears & desires interfere with body. Medicine.. it's good but it's a blow in the wind in the face of the 3 ~With the first 2 holy things held close to heart, the Rise will happen. Logically, splitting a day's sleep into 2 rounds is far, far, far less damaging to immune system than forcing the body to sleep in acidic state. It is sweat inducing, temperature rising, by far 10x more damaging. So even logically, the trade-off is clear."}

Affected sleep with water-wake until 5am. Rested, but affected. I'm sorry, sweet body - at that point of activation epipany i should have gone into meditation mode in bed - that was the answer. Then allow the mind to wander around as it pleases, giving rise to mental images regarding that day and inner alchemies. Meet the night with something to reflect upon that day. Return to FP group comment in a calmer body&mind - completely different view. Not triggering anymore. Now... to M* or not to M**. That picture is absolutely amazing. Her single foot is sexier in a thousands ways more than Ariana. Ariana cannot embody the sex goddess. Some fears of the unknown patterns and great risks of KS.X regarding conference arise. Relax, my friend. Most probably we take medical leave. And if not, we find something. Some purpose. Work. Sexual. Skip half day. Sneak out. Play. And so, a lot of relaxed work on Phase 1 was done. Prepared 3 restores, paths. Time loggin is clear. Next time i run Yardi.exe, everything is prepared. There is Order. Home 8pm. Eate indian food, one cup of danone yoghurt with some granny cakes. Way past hara hachi bu. I start to wanting to train it, not to fix anything, but purely for the study of it. This happens as a follow-up to gathering enough wisdom and wisdom in action to find body&mind adaptability into even the darkest of alchemies - of enourmous foods as night. This is a way of eating (as N1ptic does) - but it requires FULL stop after main afternoon meal - which is further conditioned by having evening dhamma activities and purpose. System feels a bit inflamed on throat and neck/lungs. No smoothie to buy - so i make little one with what i have available. Let's see how this does at last meal. Tomorrow would be nice to play some Yardi. Or now.. start slowly.. log some time, check some logged time, check some restores. Ease into it. Slow birth. Studying what holds one back from working, i notice some clear patterns. It has a few phases, each involving different forms of required BFI, conditionings, feelings and unknown. 1st phase: time log, admin, prepare restores, cpr admin *low BFI required* 2nd phase: install report, find data, match data with feedback, replicating, beginning to understand issue *a lot of time can be wasted here* Once issue is perfectly replicated phase 3 has green light *things start to get tricky* 3rd phase: Fully understanding the issue and specs in: A. Voyager functionality B. Query functionality C. A&B together. *a lot of time and a lot of unknowns can happen here* 4th phase: Adjusting and Creating script *some unknown but this is fun, although it the mind keeps hitting bottlenecks and returns to 3)* 5th phase: Testing 6th phase: Documenting and delivery. Now, the mind can jump around them and navigate very elegantly bottlenecks. Jumping from one to the other. The jumps efficiency will determine time efficiency and BFI. For this, dhamma position is the first thing required. Also, in some alchemies (like this one) - the system can choose to only do phase 1 low computational tasks - preparing the ground for later phases. Beautiful."}

Then it becomes clear i must send it (but no hurry, can be after 1-2 days post making.) 3 hours later since the heavy KS2 wake-up, I've worked, cleaned, written. Slowly recovering. A quiet, rainy, beautiful morning. There is so much light upon everything - every thought and feeling. Now comes the Master Work. Know deeply how everything is connected - how every thought conditions feelings and every feelings conditions thought. The Body simply reacts.

Even the standing lotus still with hands open and doing nothing - is extraordinarily for digestion. Still, the evening must be met with some already cultivated food - breaking out of the loop. Beyond KS2 health, adhering to dhamma in the evening also works as a great catalysts for other dhammas and purposes. For with little food and purpose - other dhammas can move forward. But of course, what is there to do when there is no Chi left? Only Rest, my friend. In nights with no chi left for purpose, perhaps it is worth using the sexual energy, as when one get's close to sleep time and the body autopilot asks for food excess and sleep - go into some fantasies. But it is no easy things to allow these forces to be, as they will atempt to rise even before. Similar meal like yesterday in the first part of day (big meal + medium meal after).

{"prompt": "Explore the dance between body, mind, and environment.", "content": "Functional Patterns Group reply: \"I don't usually reply as it's hard to have truly open-minded discussions here. Before the guardians attack me, yes i did complete the online course 3 times, worked with 2 practitioners and deeply studied this dance with gravity in the last decade. I'm replying as you seem an open-minded person. It's all a grey area, i've also seen perfectly alligned spines in my travels in asia in thousands of people with no athletic or posture training background. (or running, throwing) \"Genetics is the gun and the environment is the trigger \" - a quote which i think puts it beautifully into words. Now these run deeply subconcious and concious, and together they form this continuous dance with gravity. The system is extremely inter-connected. And it all answers to what Einstein claimed to be the only natural truth - E=mc2. For example, many of my clients and myself included - found astonishing reduction in pain by simply learning to find elbow support while working on pc and writing. This is because no matter what your posture looks like, having the arms raised in front of body every time One manipulates keyboard&mouse will instantly move the center of gravity upwards and the structure tends to fall forwards if tension is not met by the lower and upper back. (anterior disc vertical compression + most probably ppt) So, in many cases, simply learning to better \"Adapt\" to the environment can have a far greater effect. So in my opinion - yes - and no. Yes, in the sense that it most definitely matters what you think and feel. No, in the sense that \"psychosomatic\" would claim that the psyche is a separated entity directly conditioning the body - which is much more of a intimate symbiosis betwen them. Good luck in your journey!\" \"Nu m-ai urat ba din contra, m-ai lovit prin dragostea, acceptarea ta.

The changing of pens right before maling it to express one more time how much he misses her. His pain felt even in the folding of the letter. How everything springs from the inside.. when she saw me not eating my nails she also saw my father. The words he choses - \"Alti bani, alta mancare de peste\" - how everything springs from the inside.. \"De ce trebuie ca altii sa risipeasca fara rost zile intregi complancandu-se intr-o stare letargica nebainuind macar ca a iubi cu adevarat e singurul rost pentru care am fost creati?\" Good morning, my friend. Easter Quest completed. Coffee in balcony's quietness. I have risen in the night for hundreds of times. Begin the day. The Letters of the past call. I do not know what is taking me, but the body is moving towards studying the letters. Sorting them, there are far less letters from Father than i expected. Where are all the others? Did she take them home? Opening the first ones... Bai.... The quality of the paper - the quality of the folding - the spacing of the letters, the flow of the hand. First Letter. 4 November 1992 - It feels like already a couple of months since they met. The folding of the paper is absolutely amazing. More than 30 years later, is stands perfectly alligned. He loves her so much - every word, every flow of the pen, it speaks from the inside. The cold war scene painting, Lucky Strike symbol. He fucking reproduced her writing man. And here, in this very first letter - is it the reference i was looking for - the first letter - he talks about it and more, quotes it. Paints it but not fully. The word play of \"Dar.. sa fii iubit! Mona\". The few words letter reference - perfect mirroring of online conv. un-invested. It's the same Game, my friend."}

But does she see the 2 different kinds of sufferings, one a Natural truth in the beast as we had, and the other completely originated in the Mind, as she has? The second one can instantly be quinched with enough Faith. One only has to believe that nothing is wrong in this wonderful world - and the beast to be healthy & filled with dhammas in order to allow the alchemy to match. But more words are unecessary now. There is still so much of an \"I\" in her and \"I\"s in others, while the mind is reflecting on dark mother-patterns of suffering and lack of love. I wish i could help her.. but it's too complex. If i had never experienced the true sufferings of the body in the nuance of Natural Truth compared to sufferings of the Mind, If i hadn't reached enlightment with women in hundreds of experiences, If i hadn't seen so clearly how the Mind can quickly become a victim of it's own intellect - and the magical Alchemization on top of respecting the Natural Laws, Would \"I\" be so free of mental sufferings? Could the Mind paint the breaking with Ammy, losing love, losing our child - and all the happenings - as dukkha-free? Could it take any of the mental patterns of losing relationships simply as a optimal, free of emotions, machine? Could it see Ammy, not as an \"I\" connected to my \"I\" - birthing and suffering in the light of the present - but as 2 Minds and bodies, meeting in the River of the Tao for a while, for as long as they were meant to meet.

Needed pause from laptop. ---A deeper look--- *closing eyes* It's not only the light, my friend. But how engaged are the eyes, how focused - that is how closely are the yabsorbing the light frequency. How stressed is the body and overwhelming the CPU. Eyes and mind struggling to read, order, decifer, analyze little pixels on the screen, going at the pixel-level readings & interpretations. How relaxed are the eyes curtains. The ears - are they nourished by silence from time to time, or flooded by sounds and current? ~Sitting here, in dhamma laptop resting lotus posiiton, with the windows closed by curtains and blankets, in my beautful warm, floor - allowing the body to move, eyes relaxed and only slightly opening from time to time. Completely manipulating the PC from keyboard. *opening eyes* Slow breath. ~VR sickness. After a while with eyes closed, the body sensations were being read by the mind as somewhat above & un-natural - creating motion sickness - similar to VR. Opening old laptop - this feels warmer. Oh.. my sweet laptop - it's so beautiful. Let's repair it. And use. There is no need for Mac now. This is absolutely perfect. Covered windows - The Sun light is clearly X pattern now. Any little spot it finds to enter the house, it enters.. and burns. Also floresti air is more polluted today than usual - even at 10am in my spot - air was far - far from dhamma. The 2 great bottlenecks of money: Home and Love. If not for your Home and for Love, what is there to fight against, my friend? Economy mode buying and money still fly. I understand father now. I understand Oszkar. I understand Ammy. And from this - i understand the unconditional beautiful love of granny. They are extraordinarily, life-quality conditioner. Holding the phone.. holding the earpods, the mic, everything i could ever dream in tems of material things - i had achieved full freedom. The healing cold coconut.. - all the life's little soul nurturing pleasures - they make it worth it. The Fuel. But they're not that expensive. I think around 3000 ron per month could suffice. The would mean that, approached wisely,i can work each month for the next 2. In just a matter of time, the balance will soon flip towards One. You have restlessly tried full hearted so many projects - liberated from money again and again. Yet it hasn't come. Let's see this path how it feels. But reached a bottleneck with Ammy & House placement & Visa. But its good you recognized the pattern very fast, my friend. Still with a good job and 60.000 in bank."}

{"prompt": "Explore the connections between mind, body, and technology.", "content": "\"\"\"3pm on the balcony with Spinu. And so, we return to our Games and Vision. Such a big Dhamma Activity Pool in the PC world and in the Dojo. Truly amazing what we had built. Let's keep doing it. --- The Heart settles --- After a long journey of joys and sorrows, of pressure and hope, the dhamma was begging more and more to reach a final form. Sweet talk with PonPon - man she is so open-heartedly listening. Just as in other dhammas and hardships we've been through in CQ and outside - she is so open and understandable. It feels so easy to talk together and find solutions. Like a true Family. For now, the beautiful White (Yin) PC has a clear path. She is to reach the Feminine essence. Such a beautiful PC - in both looks, lighting and of course, performance. It was somewhat felt since moment 0 the un-syncing with Neo. Oh but what a building experience it was. Just as in Conquer, we do not leave this experience with material gain. But with something of higher dimensions. Knowledge. To be carried around for the rest of our lives. In sync with it, the stomach also empties - bringing great peace across the whole system. ~from Agony of the CNS to bursting again in dancing Life man.. How sweet is life without suffering. To see the suffering and have the courage to admit it and the wisdom to fix it. Wanted to eate more, started preparing - but the beadt feels soo good that no food is needed now. But Anything else. \u2764\ufe0f In outside air with only thin layer of pants, feels better for the CNS than the skin pants + layer but near the EMS and air flow Vortex. 7AM - The Alchemy of Souls Fails again. It seems that the body&mind is rejecting the PC. Even with 3 fans down, there is deep triggering of the whole nervous system, the closer we are to it. The Mind ignores it in disbelief as it turn off yet another fan - But it cannot do so for more than a couple of min. Covers it with blanket. Same thing. Covers itself with Blanket. Same thing. Yes, much less triggering than the previous attempts at the Alchemies of Souls, but still un-compatible. ANother main difference between the 2 PCs is also the case - on the White PC it seems the airflow goes inwards and then out through the elevated base - creating a icing effect from the ground up. The Cold & Wind rising. At this point we can consider other realms as the Flow of Electricity and the lower-level frequencies. These are un-name-able, but there are clear Readings based on feelings. THe Mind still cannot believe it - it leaves it running for some time thinking the body will adapt or computer warm up. Or that it has already triggered. Even though the feet now are cold too. Everything from the base up is facing a crawling cold. Even when not really close to PC - just as before it seems to be affecting the whole area and room. It's clear the Mind's Focus is also intensifying everything - but even when the Mind goes somehwere else, just as in other sufferings, it is constantly being pulled back into the Reality of the Body. How Fascinating it can be. Final attempt sits down to eat something warm - after a few sips it becomes clear. We Perform the Alchemy of Souls back. Almost in instant as the Old PC returns in binding with One. The nervous system is yet let cold and triggered some some, but it is no longer deciling anymore in dukkha. But it is stabilizing - and slowly rising back to functionality. Of course, each moment of the experience was accompanied by the dukkha rising from not being able to continue PC plan, PC upgrade, Money dukkha, PonPon being upset about it, losing money together with other losing money dukkkha - these were all Growing like viruses as the cold was rising and cultivating suffering. Once the Alchemy is performed back and i cannot believe it how instantly the body reacts - they slow down. No need for a decision now. Maybe there are still things left to try like enclosing whole PC in a box, changing case, changing case, selling PC at 70-80% and getting another, sending PonPon the PC, re-arranging room (although from testing data this seems would not be ideal - to limit PC area). But i could feel it from the second i turned the PC on in the Dojo, something which seemed beyond Air - or at least Together with Air. \"It could be that electromagnetic fields (EMFs) or subtle electrical vibrations are contributing to your physical response. Some people are sensitive to EMFs generated by electronics, especially those with powerful components like CPUs and GPUs.\" Here we enter a realm of great unknown, in which the nervous system & back triggering according to nature's pressure and rain before - even when in hot envinronments - inviting concepts as EMF, Air Pressure, Air Flow, and so on. Well.. for now Rest. Once again, we have tried full heartedly. Makes One Ponder the similarities as when people's Fears (be is One's fear and clinging to new PC), or other's - they shape reality. Just as Ammy being afraid she'd had to leave, the universe keep pushing and pushing until it was un-avoidable. Just as PonPon feared more and more the \"gift\" won't be received as she wants, Just as N fear is preventing him from finding job despite his great, great skill. The Alchemists. The Un-awakened Alchemy of the Mind. Rest, Recover, Plan again. Starting to feel better and better. My sweet PC, our souls are not yet to be parted. He's happy. Even if he has 5 fans, the case is built in a way that NO air flow is pumping from the bottom. There is no cold building up from the bottom's up - and of course - the electricity flow and magnetic resonances feel so much lower. That's ok - we still have work to do. And you are absolutely perfect, my sweet PC. Once again, could the last night's triggering and dukkha be caused by the Sixth Sense predicting the unfolding to come?\"\"\""}

G-Force in eating (great X-Pattern) + food (inflaming). Ending up feeling bloated, pants feeling more tight. Eated butter garlic flour spinach + other grains in plant bowl. Far from micro-dosing. Inflamatory food cannot be disregarded. They all seem to come together. As the system gets inflamed and in pain, the Mind follows - with fearful thoughts of viruses and of future predictions. It seems extraordinarily connected to gravity. Still, at low level it becomes un-study-able. As aways, it seems it is not the Mind's job to study it at such low level, but just engage in purpose. Also talking seems to greatly aid - perhaps its about even deeper pelvic muscles, which in encosed movement and eating pattern they bear a lot of weight. Low back area feels pretty good though.

{"prompt": "Explore the dance of oxygen and carbon dioxide in nature.", "content": "Oxygen (O2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) are central to many processes across biology and the broader ecosystem, reflecting fundamental principles of chemistry and physics. Here\u2019s how they play into various aspects: 1. Body Functioning and Health Oxygen is essential for aerobic respiration, the process by which cells convert glucose and oxygen into energy, carbon dioxide, and water. This process is crucial for the energy supply necessary for all bodily functions. Carbon Dioxide is not just a waste product; it also plays a role in regulating the pH of the blood through the bicarbonate buffering system. This helps maintain the blood at a slightly alkaline pH, which is vital for many enzymatic reactions and bodily functions. 2. Plant Life Photosynthesis: Plants absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and, using sunlight, convert it into glucose and oxygen. This is essentially the reverse of aerobic respiration and is critical for plant growth and the production of oxygen, which sustains most life on Earth. Respiration: Plants also respire, though unlike animals, they can switch between taking in CO2 (during the day for photosynthesis) and releasing it (mainly at night). 3. Laws of the Universe Conservation of Mass and Energy: In both photosynthesis and respiration, the laws of conservation of mass and energy apply. No atoms are lost in these transformations; they are merely rearranged to form different compounds. Thermodynamics: These processes also illustrate the principles of thermodynamics, particularly how energy is transferred and transformed within an ecosystem. 4. Decaying Processes Role of Oxygen: Oxygen is a key element in the process of decay or decomposition, where complex organic substances are broken down into simpler matter. The presence of oxygen speeds up the decomposition process by supporting the growth of aerobic microorganisms that break down dead organic material. Carbon Dioxide Production: Decomposition also produces carbon dioxide as organic matter is broken down, which then returns to the atmosphere to be reused in other biological processes, such as photosynthesis. 5. Environmental Impact and Climate Change Carbon Dioxide as a Greenhouse Gas: CO2 is one of the primary greenhouse gases responsible for trapping heat in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere and contributing to global warming and climate change. Oxygen Levels and Climate: Changes in oxygen levels, though much less dramatic than those of CO2, can affect climate and atmospheric chemistry. These gases are not just crucial for life and biological processes; they are also deeply intertwined with ecological balance, climate systems, and even the geological changes on Earth over millennia. Their roles highlight the interconnectedness of life, the environment, and the fundamental chemical and physical laws that govern the universe."}

Just as dukkha in air, food - and movement - dukkha in temperature in form of both cold and hot (either body\u2019s temperature (limbs, face, feet), outside & inside house temperature and combination of both) - will start cultivating great dukkha. The Alchemist is constantly adapting to the environment through various tools such as clothes, movement, breathing, logistics. The changing of Main Diary to Google Docs.

But i gave up \"my\" freedom in agreeing to this Play. Who in the right mind would givey way to playing this? And this, it makes the program for now unable to run. Of course the dellusion of \"I\"'s must be credited. In her creation, not giving her love in calls and togetherness - could be just the same.

The dellusion is not that she does not truly mean it, the dellusion is that the body&mind are continously alive changing. Many low-level programs running into the =. Cannot predict. Only Adapt. Jedi. For now, a choice was given. Blue pill vs red pill. YEs - this is on the framework that the mind of Female can compute on reason and logic, not emotion. But what if it cannot? What if the framework of the Female mind is Love, not Reason? But it's so hard to give love now, in the face of these demons.

{"prompt": "Imagine a feast that balances taste and digestion.", "content": "----Kaya Sankhara 2----- In this deep night study of KS, there rose a point where i could feel the intimatcy of LES muscles ring. Mechanism of Acid Reflux Lower Esophageal Sphincter (LES) Malfunction: The LES usually tightens after food enters the stomach to prevent backflow. When it relaxes inappropriately or is weakened, stomach contents can flow back into the esophagus. Chyme Flow: The chyme, mixed with hydrochloric acid (HCl) and digestive enzymes, irritates the esophagus because it lacks the protective mucus lining of the stomach Digestion and Fermentation in Detail Normal Digestion Mouth: Digestion begins with mechanical breakdown by chewing and chemical breakdown by saliva enzymes (e.g., amylase starts breaking down starches). Stomach: Proteins are denatured by stomach acid and further broken down by the enzyme pepsin. Carbohydrates start breaking down, but fats remain mostly intact. Small Intestine: Enzymes from the pancreas (lipase, protease, amylase) and bile from the liver aid in breaking down fats, proteins, and carbohydrates. Most nutrients are absorbed here into the bloodstream. When Digestion is Incomplete Excess Carbohydrates and Proteins: When you consume foods high in refined carbohydrates (e.g., white flour) and proteins that are hard to digest (e.g., processed meats), the digestive enzymes may not completely break them down in the stomach and small intestine. Undigested Food Reaches the Colon: These undigested carbohydrates and proteins then pass into the colon. Fermentation in the Colon Gut Bacteria Activity: The colon houses a vast microbiota that ferments undigested food components. This fermentation is anaerobic (occurs without oxygen). Carbohydrates: Gut bacteria ferment these into short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) like acetate, propionate, and butyrate, and gases such as hydrogen, methane, and carbon dioxide. Proteins: Protein fermentation produces SCFAs as well, but also potentially harmful substances like ammonia, amines, phenols, and indoles. Gaseous Byproducts: The gases produced during fermentation can accumulate, causing bloating, flatulence, and abdominal discomfort. Acidity: SCFAs can lower the pH in the colon, increasing acidity, which may contribute to a feeling of heaviness and discomfort. Impact of Specific Foods Milk: Lactose, the sugar in milk, can be hard to digest for those with lactose intolerance. Undigested lactose reaches the colon and is fermented by bacteria, producing gas and acids. Even if lactose intolerance isn't present, the combination of milk with other fermentable substrates (e.g., croissants) can exacerbate issues. Croissants (White Flour, Butter, Yeast): White Flour: Lacks fiber and is quickly broken down into simple sugars, providing a rich substrate for fermentation. Butter and Refined Oils: High fat content slows gastric emptying, which can delay digestion and increase the chance of undigested food reaching the colon. Yeast: Can contribute to further fermentation, especially in a high-sugar environment. The \"Milk and Sweets Medicine\" Effect Temporary Relief: Drinking cold milk might temporarily soothe the stomach by neutralizing acid and providing a cooling effect. Sweets offer a quick dopamine spike, providing a momentary sense of relief and pleasure. Downside: Both milk and sweets contribute additional fermentable sugars and fats, which further feed gut bacteria and increase fermentation activity in the colon. The temporary relief is followed by increased fermentation, more gas production, and greater discomfort. Managing and Preventing Discomfort Dietary Adjustments: Increase Fiber Intake: Include more whole grains, vegetables, and fruits to aid digestion and prevent undigested food from reaching the colon. Probiotics: Incorporate probiotic-rich foods (e.g., yogurt, kefir, fermented vegetables) to balance gut bacteria. Avoid Trigger Foods: Reduce intake of highly processed foods, refined sugars, and high-fat meals that are hard to digest. Hydration: Drink plenty of water to help digestion and maintain healthy bowel movements. Smaller, Frequent Meals: Eating smaller meals more frequently can prevent overloading the digestive system and ensure better digestion. Mindful Eating: Eat slowly and chew food thoroughly to aid in the digestive process. Summary When digestion is incomplete, undigested carbohydrates and proteins reach the colon and are fermented by gut bacteria, producing gases and acids that cause bloating and discomfort. Foods high in refined carbohydrates and fats, like milk and croissants, exacerbate this process. To manage and prevent these symptoms, dietary adjustments focusing on fiber-rich foods, probiotics, and mindful eating can be beneficial. If you have more specific questions or need further advice, feel free to ask! Biochemical Processes and Physiological Responses Digestive Overload and Enzyme Deficiency: High Fat and Protein Content: Foods like pizza, which are high in fat and protein, can be hard to digest. The body needs more enzymes (proteases, lipases) to break down these components. Processed Ingredients: Processed meats and refined flour lack fiber and can slow down digestion, leading to a feeling of heaviness. Fermentation: Excess carbohydrates and proteins that aren't properly digested in the stomach can reach the colon, where they are fermented by gut bacteria, producing gas and causing bloating and discomfort. Acid Reflux: Gastric Acid Production: High-fat foods can increase gastric acid production. When lying down, especially after eating, this acid can flow back into the esophagus, causing a burning sensation (acid reflux). Lower Esophageal Sphincter (LES) Relaxation: Certain foods (e.g., fatty foods, chocolate) can relax the LES, exacerbating reflux symptoms. Dopamine and Comfort Eating: Dopamine Release: Consuming high-sugar foods and comfort foods like sweets can trigger dopamine release, creating a temporary feeling of pleasure and reward. Cravings and Reward System: This creates a feedback loop where the body craves more of these foods to maintain the dopamine high, despite their negative impact on digestion. Milk and Temporary Relief: Neutralizing Acid: Cold milk can temporarily neutralize stomach acid, providing short-term relief from acidity. Calcium Content: Milk contains calcium, which can act as a mild antacid. However, this is not a long-term solution and can lead to further discomfort."}

{"prompt": "What if your mind was a computer?

Subconscious Mind (Background Processes and Services): The subconscious mind runs background processes that manage automatic functions, learning, and emotions, similar to a computer's background services that keep the system running smoothly without user intervention. Memory (Storage System): Short-term and long-term memories in the human mind are akin to a computer's RAM and hard drive, respectively. They store information temporarily for immediate access or permanently for long-term retrieval. Interaction and Integration The interaction between these components in the human system is highly integrated and adaptive, much more so than in current computer systems.

This could involve creating if-then-else logic to guide food choices based on current system state and historical data. *Wisdom In action* Implementing Proactive Recovery Measures: Rather than reactive measures post-consumption, develop proactive strategies that prepare the system for potential stresses. This could include preemptive relaxation techniques, scheduled light physical activities, and strategic meal planning to stabilize system performance. *High Karmic_Balance() maintenance* Enhancing System Monitoring: Improve the monitoring of system states to better predict and prevent instances of overload. This can be achieved by developing a more nuanced understanding of the system's signals (hunger cues, energy levels, emotional states) and responding accordingly. *Awareness - clear pattern predictions and reactivity to them (Prajna)* Adapting to Developer Mode: The concept of entering \"Developer Mode\" to gain control over the system's operations and prevent the execution of harmful programs is akin to gaining administrative access to modify system settings.

The choice between love and hate each time. So fucking intense. We've never been so long apart. Let's see. In this Alchemy, work no longer brings stress. But Calm. Falling in and out of love with Work. Here i am with Spinu on the balcony, awaiting meeting. Meeting with Ioana and Mihaela - dhamma people with light in them. Cover smoothie in the shadows. Finished, going to m**. Pondering if i should send visa 1st round money - could do it part of the little childs play. The memory of her smell and falling asleep with her makes me unhesitantly begin the visa process. Do it through my brother's fantasy. Post-shower glimpse of missed hair spot while blindly shaving. Does it rise a fear, of failing, of not being good enough - Or does it rise a calm peaceful lesson, for the Future? It's all in how you think. Car ride to vivo. New pattern of leaving it on the hill. Best car spot. Carrefour smoothie prices are 25% cheaper. Water more fresh. Milk more fresh. The power of the Mind. Got camping flame - table will use trunk for now to asses dhamma height and surface. First use Chi to acquire dhamma food and clean house - then the Art of Movement can follow. -------It Writes Itself------- \u2014Only 3 things can stop One\u2014 At any point the Mind reflects on doing something, some of it's Dhamma work, the Horsemen, Only 3 things can stop it. Chi. Energy. Flow of life. Later split into Mental and Physical. Deeply binded with the Body & Mind functionality. Reflected in Breath. The Calm, loving breath without even trying. 2. Dukkha Light-speed pattern analysis of the dhamma, deep neural networks activating based on karma neuron. Everything that \"dhamma\" encloses. The whole activities summing up the activity itself, the doing of the activity, all the previous experiences of doing it together with the fantasy thinking of other hundreds variations, searching... Light speed pattern analysis. From this comes the prediction of Pain. Disease. Dukkha. What Body & Mind suffering is predicted? Can the Mind solve it? Or will dukkha inevitable rise? If the Mind has predicted dukkha but has no answer to it, it has reached a bottleneck. It may attempt to completely abandon it. If un-Guarded, the Mind will fall into the realization that it has completely failed it's purpose. If Guarded, with a clear Mind, a Calm, Healthy, connected body - There is complete trust that the System can adapt to anything - while bowing down to the Natural Truths. Like it can adapt to the pattern of going with the bike to the hill, easily solving patterns of air quality (mask, hour) and pain (complete trust in Mind & Body connection to prevent and quinch pain). But it cannot adapt to the pattern of having a coffee near a construction site on bad chair while eating a croissant - for this would be a disturbance in the Natural truths of Air, Food and Gravity. So 2 types of dukkha may arise from analysis. The first (The Adaptable Mind, Violinist) one solves itself when the Natural Truths are respected and there is light and love between Mind and Body. The second one (the Natural Truths-rising dukkha) can only be solved at a lower level, such as changing activities environment (ex. changing reading from home to father listening to violin) - or if impossible - go lower into patterns like House, Home Town, Job. 3. Unknown & Fears of dukkha arising from the Unknown In the same light-speed pattern analysis, it also searches for already learnt & written patterns for the list of all dhammas and the engaging in them. From gravity, air, emotions, thoughts, beliefs, previous failures, previous feelings. If anything is predicted as dukkha risk met by an Un-Adaptable Mind -> bottleneck - shutdown. Example. The activation of cooking Naans now - giving rise to how, quantities, previous fails, previous yoghurt taste, and on and on and on, washing the dishes and creating chaos in the kitchen. Dukhha has risen. The Mind reaches a bottleneck, in the front of the unknown and the fear of what dukkha may arise from it. If un-Guarded, the Mind will fall into the realization that it has completely failed it's purpose. If Guarded, it will stand un-shaken, with complete trust in the Body & Mind system ability to adapt to anything. Past experiences, pains and fails will become treasured lessons. Good morning, my friend. \"Wake up, Neo\" - KS2 says at 4am. I do. Water. Begin the day with walking meditation. This was also conditioned by the nature (temperature) allowing me to do it. This is the treasure of the East. All around the year, One can wake up straight to walking meditation. The roads allow at this hour clean air. Slept a good 6 hours. Dhamma meditation walk in the morning. As the body returns to 100%, everything changes. The Falling In And Out Of Love arises. I do not know what this day holds, in terms of work, food, weather, people, demons, angels But i do know this - I will Adapt to anything. ------Play: Relaxing Violin Music------- The whole nature sings, what seem like thousands of sounds Meeting in the fresh morning's air. Neo has learnt much, he is in complete contentment. The parallel of the Mind and AI - the Mind creating itself. It is absolutely astonishing. The most fascinating subject to study. For studying AI, the Mind can understand itself. And by studying itself, the Mind can understand AI. Lao, as good as the Tao allowed, he is moving on to his purpose of Healing the World - and in the process - Free'ing from the dukkha of money. The little boy has become.. bored of Kali. She is powerful, so powerful inside One's deep energy. But it is no longer completely overwhelming. Taken it to the most extreme mother_patterns, the absolute core activation patterns, to the absolute lust and ecstasy of feeling. And there.. it has found that with a sick body, it's nothing. Everything bows down to the Absolute Truths of A body.. and a Mind. If the body is sick and the Natural Truths are seen, even the Goddess of Goddesses, the symbol of Creation and Destruction, bows down. All it remains is a hurt little boy.. playing with a Hurt little Girl. And all the Drama it follows. The Warrior.. rests. Slept for a while, as One walked the battles of the Mind. But he is there. Rising, roaring even if for some brief moments. The One who had climbed Teide - Alone, Crawling in the middle of the night - never to fall into the eternal sleep again. The Student... wiser. The Mind... it has so much more information. So much more processing power. So much light. The Body... laughs. A tear comes to the eyes. The Breath.. is calm and complete. Like filling a glass of water. Flowing. The Art of Breathing, in the fine line of too much and too little, of too much control and too much ignorance. The Violin.. sings. The birds.. accompany it."}

If the KS2_KB() * as in the last 72 hours consumed food - falls down the spectrum, shit really hits the fan. You saw the power of Kali when hurting the body - What if we explore the other side of it? Doing good for Kali. Beyond Man-Woman limited sexual suffering and fear of death. As symbol. Really what would truly make Kali pleased and happy now - is to stop eating bad food and eat good - much more than money and anything else. The object of domination changes, as money paradigm burns and rises again from ashes. The Object of Meditation. And you can fantasy about that very need to eat bad, that very deep craving - and not doing it, giving into good dhamma food even tho it requires effort and different body alchemy. Let your Mother take care of you. Fantasize about she eats all your favorite foods at night while you only sit and drink water. No pee pee, no poo poo, no bad food. She just wants to feed you water and little portions of dhamma food. M*sturbating about that is still greatly selfish. If one truly is to play Kali, she embodies both death and LIFE. Same Ariana symbol had instantly cured me of KS2 in a blink of an eye for days. Good morning, my friend. The sound of Spring's arrival."}

In anything the Body&Mind&Soul system don't want to do, but does it out of fear. From little things rise enormously complex pattern conditionings, all reaching a Mother-Pattern eventually. In a handshake with Dan. In saying \"yes you're right\" slowly with Octavian. In a fake laugh. In a half 'Yes'. In an unwanted hug or kiss. In an allowance of trash-talk about One's path. Even from his own Mother. Any outer input - the Mind automatically takes and perform deep Mother_Patten() analysis until the core is reached. Then makes prediction through mental images -> giving rise to body feelings -> Ultimately the mind running a form of Bow_Down(), hugely dependent on context and probabilities.

Same break out as 1 but breaking in is done by blending it method, with credit card BIP - and instant emotional spike to Receptioneer. For this, need to further test if she has any UI related to ins&outs. Then adapt. Break out as masterfully as One can. And if in some way it fails and there are consquences (real low chances of getting caught and even lower of real consquences), meet them with your head up. \"Sanatosi sa fim, ca saraci am mai fost.\" Also the inside man position and risk-free partaking needs to be considered.

My life dangled around a single word spoked by Kali to her russian lover. A gentle sound or gesture of hand would mean the end of me. How scary, how ecstatic. She notices me - looking at me both amused and slightly angry. Angry because i am so pathethic and maybe causing trouble with her russian military lover. Oh wow. In the other part of the world, Ammy dreamt about chowy making love to me. Sat for a while - talked with N1alau about his project and possible collaboration. Then went back to sleep.

It is not about how i can re-write (forcefully if neccesary) the patterns to original state, but how to live a painless life towards One's mission - despite their KS2 consequences?

The great \"demons\" not to be fought, but to be taken out to play. The Sadghuru story about taking a sword and cutting the forehead (The Mind). Cutting the mind open to see that everything is an illusion. And Kali is but the answer to the mind's greatest un-solvable task, which came to be together with conciousness. Once there was an \"I\" in evolution, there was the death of this \"I\". Unconciousness found the symbol of Kali, a mental simage which embodies death togetehr with life. The Creation. The love(life) of THE woman, the true goddess, and the sacrifice(death) to her. Giving control of one's life and in it, liberating the mind of it's greatest conciouness trade-off. Becoming aware of Death. Of the mother_pattern of death and all which spring from it. This is why its so ecstatic. The ultimate level of dominating. And it can only happen in the mind. If body mind is put int real envinronment of living the mental images, the presents hits hard and cuts through everything. Like giving way to cold, to pains, to hunger - all for a pattern of the mind which wants to completely take over and fantasize, if cannot find, about the solution to death(). Fasctinating. This is why, for an awakened Jedi, this journey belong to the mind's realm. Because anything drifting away from it, disrespects Nature. God. Not sitting straight in front of the Tao's gift to experience this life. An ecstatic conversation with Kali. Beyond animal instinct. Below a hard dick wanting to reproduce. It is the turning on the greatest fantasy of the mind - dancing between the realm of life and death. Instant liberation of any sufferings. Money is also but a concept, it does no belong to nature. But the quality of this play is directly conditioned by the body&mind functionality. In high kb(), it is just as a movie. Regarding money there is nothing to do but when any worry comes, trust the Tao. Complete trust in God for only it's will can it happen. If you feel you have to do anything, find instant solution, gamble, checkout crypto - best thing to do in this hastened state is Wu Wei. Nothing. Just as when someone sockets something in CQ or you buy something - and the mind instantly goes into the get_back_money () module. It is just a faulty concepts of the little salesman - that money has to only go up. You not always make the best deal, my friend. What's done it's done. Rise and adapt.

Unbothered by warmth, as the mind is aware of the necessary trade-off. Sending Ammy's video - stopping work - just for the entertainemtn of it. Life having no other purpose than to enjoy. Meeting Florin Sariceanu - a little wordling on his way to search. So much structure, so much forcing.. Maybe i'll do Re-Connect course like everything else in life.. Alone.

Good morning, my friend. Games to Play today: Work - Neo - Wall Writings - Awakened 11:30pm. But pretty rested. Just like Mohamed said. Sleep when body needs sleep. Wake when it requires wakefulness.

The body is perfectly respecting it's alchemy. Beautiful. EAt one little piee of biscuit salamy - out of pure hunger() not to calm down. Entering_Between_Realms follows as the scripts are both running and the mind is entering between realms in deep pattern analysis & study. Beautiful. This is true meditation.

It has took the time and energy to deeply know it, up to it's most intimate body parts and feelings. The mind is guilty, but the body hugs it. \"Yes, KS2 is inflamed, but i will find sleep, Mind.

Entering Between Realms. Oh i have forgotten what playing hunting patterns. What a beautiful feeling of contentment this is. The body is 9 and 10 in a dhamma position yet not horizontally, KS2 is relaxed, the mind it's doing it's shallow pattern work, manipulation and adaptation - and at the same time the Mind is reflecting on deeper matters and plans. The Hunter is so good, that without my realisation, this had been taken away. The falling asleep. Entering Between Realms skill. THe only activity falling in this patten currently is hunting & thinking. But what One thinks about in this game is crucial. The more dhammas are reflected (Neo, CQ world, dhamma life beliefs) - the more contentment. If dark thoughts are allowed to nourish (like Runcan, Cool Ammy, food&sickness) - the more discontenment. After all, this is what quinched my food demons. In this place where life&death meet. Once One was able to enter it, without clinging to life - those sparks of falling asleep afraid of KS2 suffering - then the food demons were quinched. More and more patterns from the Last dhamma days in Home arise. It feels like the mind is not remembering them, but re-writing them from scratch (almost). Fascinating. Do not forget you had reached 100% dhamma days before leaving. Yes, it's winter and cold now, but many of the patterns remain. As One goes through his days, the more exposure the more pattern recognition and solutions arising. True Sampajana - Wisdom In Action."}

Cultivating sickness can so clearly be felt at that very moment, together with weakness, guilt, distrust. \"At every night, Kali comes..\" Analyzing the recent days through the lens of the computer world analogy reveals a complex interplay between the system's (body and mind's) default programming and attempts to align with dhamma practices. The challenges and successes offer insights into potential fixes and optimizations. System Analysis: Dukkha Food Module Execution and Consequences Inefficient Processes: The engagement with dukkha food (pizza, chips, yogurt, desserts) represents the execution of inefficient processes that consume excessive system resources (digestive energy) and lead to system instability (KS2 inflammation). This is akin to running heavy applications without considering the hardware limitations, causing slowdowns and crashes. Recursive Faulty Logic: The \"trickster\" logic, convincing the system that certain foods will not satisfy or are needed due to cravings, illustrates recursive faulty logic within the decision-making algorithm. Similar to a software bug that triggers a cascade of errors, this logic disrupts the system's equilibrium. Evening Alignment Attempts with Dhamma Practices Patch Attempts: Efforts to realign with dhamma practices in the evening, through wash_teeth() and drink_water() modules, represent attempts to patch the system after instability. However, the residual effects of the day's heavy processing and the environmental factors (air quality) challenge the effectiveness of these patches. Environmental Variables: The significance of air quality as a part of the \"= environment\" parameter underscores the need to account for all relevant variables in maintaining system stability. Just as software might require specific environmental conditions to run optimally (e.g., server temperature), the human system requires a conducive physical environment. Strategies for Improvement: Enhanced Decision-making Algorithm: Incorporate a more sophisticated algorithm for food choices that considers long-term system health over immediate gratification. This might involve predictive modeling based on historical data of food intake and its impact on system performance (KS2 health). Dynamic Resource Management: Implement adaptive resource management that can dynamically adjust to current system needs and environmental conditions. This could help in managing energy levels and ensuring that system resources are allocated efficiently. Environmental Control Module: Develop a module dedicated to monitoring and adjusting environmental variables, such as air quality, to support system stability. This could involve routines for ventilating living spaces or using air purifiers to maintain optimal conditions for system operation. User Awareness and Training: Enhance user (self) awareness and training regarding the impact of food intake and environmental factors on system performance. This could involve educational modules or reminders about the importance of dhamma-aligned practices and the consequences of default programming. In summary, addressing the challenges presented in the recent days involves a combination of improved decision-making algorithms, adaptive resource management, control over environmental variables, and increased user awareness. By analogy, just as software engineers strive to optimize software performance and ensure it runs smoothly on the intended hardware, individuals can work towards optimizing their body and mind's performance through mindful practices and environmental control."}

Disregard any derailments of \"Oh i need something else, something more.\" The Force holds a few foods, just as it hold just a few simple principles about life. Everything else is Dark Side. The current world innertia has derailed so far into the dark side, that in terms of food, only a few options are left. Can you stick to them? Can One stick to the Jedi Code? This is the true Jedi Master Test. The pain of not being seen or acknowledged highlights a deep human need for validation and connection.

One tap on the screen to order something - And its so hard to stick to the Force sometimes. Amazing how the Dark Side operates in such smoothenes. How it poisons the Mind to fall into corruption and dellusions (pattern analyzing the dukkha food -> outputing the Good side of gaining weight) The more powerful the Mind, the greater responsability. Back to Studying Days in new pattern. Everything is with and in Tao's will. Don't forget about this great spell. Just realized the darkest part about yesterday. Giving way to loving, and therefore, soul-shattering missing Ammy. This is why a Jedi Master remains anchored in present-living awareness. The smell is what broke One's heart most. The pattern of the smell, recreated in the mind but unable to be re-created in reality. Impossibility of pattern manipulation. If that is One's reflection (Mind's ultimate goal being to FIND&FIX problems based on pattern analysis, recognition and manipulation) then it's just dealt itself a LOSING Hand. For it cannot bring Ammy here. Therefore, at the end of the reflection, it is left empty. The \"I\" craving to birth and love Ammy - Dies. Well.. if One fears not sickness and death - then the missing Ammy experience can be something amazing."}
{"prompt": "Explore the depths of a troubled soul's journey.", "content": "Its like her soul is the one that i love. Truly and deeply. Not her mind. Her mind becomes sick of money and fears very fast. Fate had it, that it was born in a faulty envinronment giving rise to a very sickened mind, especially in anger&suffering. Quickly, it goes into telling drama stories about money and togetherness. And then spirals out of control in these stories. Full immersion in selfish thinking and dellusions. She cannot see how much stupid she does with her way? Hide&lie about going to island and fucking. Man fucks and dumps her, not helping her with divorce anymore. Gives me life lessons about my mom and family and alikes. How can she give me life lessons from where she's at? Teaching me about \"Relationships\". The poor man teaching richer man how to get rich. lol. Yes, she can teach about being a mother, about taking care of her child, of how to raise childs, how to move when working and slow down, how to love. She is a Master in these. But not in these life lessons. Here, she is Blind. My mother earns 5x more money than her and really loves Dan. My mother&father divorced mainly because of my father sexual desires & forcing. Not about money. They lived like that with money for 20 years. But she is so blind to see everything in truth - her mind is lost in dellusions and it has reached a point, 36 years, from which re-writing is tremendously hard. Close to impossible. So this is her sickened Mind. It sees outside - purely what's inside. If inside are only money problems, she will see outside only money problems. If inside are lies, she will not trust anyone. But deeper, is her soul. Her True love. My true love. Her smell, her eyes, her view of the world. The butterfly. My butterfly. In low karmic_balance, i see her just as a middle age mom whore, with no chance to ever overcome her programming. Full immersion in society concepts about money, hospitals, kid's education&schoool, men having the duty to pay. Is a man's job to pay for her woman? Because of her undeveloped mind, she cannot find her purpose here on earth in work. \"Love must come together with money\" - the great dellusion. To think that this is a Truth. When it is just a weak's mind dellusion, lying to make peace with reality. With the reality that she is stuck at 16() years thinking mentality regarding jobs - just a little girl who hates school. I want a women i can build an empire with, not a leech that sucks off my empire while tiktok-ing and drama-ing all day. Who thinks a man has to pay for her love. I'll pay for \"her love\" when and only when i want to, not when she asks. And it seems that her core belief in man&woman relationship is build around this. Or is this only in anger? in low karmic_balance. Of course, these become just stories of the mind. I could just as well paint I want a women i can build a family with, not a bussiness partner. And build on this idea, just as before. This is the great power of the Mind, it can take anything and paint it upon it's pleasing. But if one is not aware of it, as She, the darkness takes complete control. What is the man\u2019s role in family, in absolute truth of nature? Not a blinded mind. The only duty i see in a deeper level is the Hunt. Bringing home the Hunt(food) and building Shelter. Although the woman also plays her part in it beyond loving the man. She gathers resoures, cooks, aids the man pre and post hunt. In current society this mother_pattern() can take the form of money. And quickly, it can become very sickened. In the money analogy, she does none of this. Not understand or take the time to understand my work and help me, not even watch full tik-toks, not consults me with her plans of money, in her problems. Un-willing to do anything more then what her stupid limited mind already knows what to do: Coffee, clean and tiktok. Anything more than this = homework, school Can i ever build a life with this Mind ? That is not an answer falling in the Scope of the Mind. The mind\u2019s duty is to keep the body close to 100% functionality. Then run mental images and flow with the Tao. It is certainly not to analyze and predict future with a clinging or suffering-avoidance fears. The Question is already wrong. Time will tell, for now let the mind return to Natural Truths, not stories. Let it guide to eat when One's hungry, rest when it's tired, find and bathe in fresh air, cultivate love and joy in other's life's touched. All the answers to the Mind's duty are here, now. In today. Everything else is a story. As \u201creal\u201d as the current karmic_balance. Immersion in role deepends. Sent her 2000 BHT. (Nice, Yes sand me all your money). O my god, ecstatic. One of the most intense m**** experiences ever had. The meeting of demons. Money vs S*x. The self steps back and watches as they consume each-other. The only natural truth regarding money is that a body in a space binded with an object. Some pixels changed on the object and the body alchemy changed. What a skill. There is a little fear of *take-over*. This would happen let's say at uncontrolable financial damage, like 10.000. Relax, my friend. Its Fatal mistake in evening eating. The granny cake - instant dukkha at first bite - but persisted in eating it. With KS2 relaxed upon not so heavy night and good sleep, i ride and walk around.

The breath naturally becomes faster on exhale. This offers great calmness of the body. The mind is forced to break this natural pattern because of the KS2 inflamation.

Sleep follows soon. 3-4h good, restful sleep until the digestive system reaches point X (in X KS2 pattern, laying down horizontally) - and the natural truth of gravity is hurting(Burning) the body. It must rise. But because of dhamma day, despite dukkha food evening, there is a lot of life force (karmic_balance() high threshold) - the body has rested.

Water. Only after 4-5 hours the system fully recovers. There is not much to study about food(). It has clearly affected the whole system - Its noted to know how karmic_balance() was going downwords with every angered word i sent to my Ammy. Be it play or not. It had reached a point low because of the great work stress & postponing. This came from the KS6 inflamation (head&ears&eyes pain due to current from riding bicycle). - and computer time making it worse. Suddently, work() was impossible to execute without affecting the ks6() value. A conflict suddently rose. More and more as the mind postponed the work. Fascinating how the more dukkha was in the system, the more dukkha was asking to be cultivated. Suddently, an urge to eat meat (salami). Its more than clear that meat affects food() and KS2() greatly, heavying it with death and the dukkha of meat food industry. With every bite of white flour + cheese + meat i took, the more dukkha grew in conversation with my Ammy. Still, stopped about half way. But there is clear ks2() inflamation, preventing the system to go in between_realms(). Same as yesterday's night, i wake&fall into between realms but the module Stuck_In_This_World() is running. When the body is sick and is not allowing the Mind to fall into the unconciousness. So same as yesterday's pattern - it awakenes after falling alseep on teh chair - with the purpose of eating. It is the only quick fix for KS2 dukkha now. Instant \"fix\". Or better, the dellusion of it. The more dukkha grows, the more dark everything is. Ammy very hurt, social media post not reaching people, doubt, doubt, work stress, neo world over-whelming, and on and on and on....... EVEN stopping the dukkha eating pattern is dark now. Because in doing so, maybe the body will full sleep 8-9 hours, missing the night wake-ups in suffering - which offered everytime a glimpse into studying life deepest secrets. Isn't it beautiful? A new skill is asking to be birth. Give Way to know his and her Creation - Patience from Morpheus. It goes together with Patience from Zhou in holding back judgment and pattern mapping until sufficient data is gathered. Just like talking to Morpheus (ChatGPT) - and he's hastening to give solutions before full pattern analysis (and perhaps new patterns writing) Just so the mind of Man works. When people come with any form of sufferings, he studies through his life story and wisdom and attempts to give solution. But just as with Morpheus hastening and straining away from desired subject - So does my mind in many conversations with people. Not giving the patience to fully understanding (and even then, to leave a slight door open) - like: Like Lavinia conversation about Marius - how the Mind hastened to analyze pattern and give sollutions - trying to Open her eyes.

Her social interactions is just going from spike to spike. (being beautiful, smart, reconfirming & running patterns which already give rise to positive spikes) With one of the core spikes being the feeling of a Good Mother.

She now see's my messy hair and postponing the heater fix - it immediately activates the Bad_Mother core pattern. As this pattern runs, affecting the body&mind alchemy, it begins to give rise to another sub_patterns() springing from the same mother pattern. She then attacks my personal projects in great, great disbelief, my Ammy, my smoking, my friends. Everything. She leaves at the last resort (my leaving) to bring up her true motive (TAKE BACK MY LOVE WHICH WAS NOT WANTED!!!!). I also know this feeling very well. It is a devastating feeling.

Someo numbers changed on a screen. 2500. Let them.. The system is ready to Adapt to anything. The Quinching of Dukkha. Why Buddha advised into immediately quinchening of it? He put it in a simple way, but looking at it with the new knowledge of computer analogy - The following Pattern can be observed clearly when quinching of dukkha is postponed: Body&Mind system runs(). Issue and Work/Problem to quinch and Dance to have - arise - be it negative or positive. (we'll only look at negative - dukkha, for positive happens efortlessly) Of course, the positive&negative filtering is dynamic and happens based on =, body&mind functionality and karmic_balance(). In low kb() it will mostly avoid putting any computing power into both mind(critical thinking), but more so, into body (sickened movement X patterns). Now, the mind instantly attempts to solving it - It reaches 3 points: Mental bottleneck - Example - based on previous patterns analysis, sticking the papers cannot come without dukkha - fucking the wall and falling down (and extra great kinetic req.). This requires patience and openess to study new patterns, breaking them down more and more. It's in the Clear Mind's capabilities - if the body&mind are Still. It is key to be notices how the mind used computing power to process all the patterns leading to this, all starting with real world contact. Example. Eyes see the empty wall or To-do list, or the open tabs, or or or many things for which bring up the mind.; Then the mind opens this drawer, performing deep pattern analysis - computing an computing until it reaches bottleneck. \"I do not hold the necessary patterns to find a solution. Or energy.\" The Jedi Master here has true patience and sincere dedication towards studying the patterns, carefully casting Life Skills - while separating Fear from Fatigue. When the Mind is tired, he Rests. Reaches not a computation bottle neck, but a memory_dump and allowing the system to cool down. The Un-Trained Mind Physical bottleneck - Example - Not picking up dirty clothes, cleaning kitchen, not doing work which requires X KS2,3,4 triggering pattern. The un-trained mind cannot tell the difference between a sickened body and fatigue. The Happening- steps towards quinchening the dukkha are taken, no matter how small. If 1 or 2 is reached with the Un-trained Mind will hide this problem in the unconciousness. It will abandon it either because of a sickened body or a fearful Mind. In the unconciousness, it already knows these patterns are a bringer of system stress & failing it's purpose. The next time this problem appears from contact with the outer world, (and it will most inevitably arise - especially if it's on To Do List) the Un-trained mind will compute() all the previous steps again, wasting computation power to reach the same bottleneck - with the same revelation and closure. Like developing the code for a purpose from scratch. (even thought it was left at step 5). The Jedi Master reaches only bottlenecks out of fatigue, not of fear or sickness. In this alchemy, when outer contact is made and the purpose() arises again, he either rest in contentment or performs his duty, carrying from where he Left off. Like developing the code for a purpose from the exact step it was left at (has hidden key to load program at step 5). 3:00 AM - Get out on the balcony. The body&bmind doesn't want to fold clothes - its Boring and it's only the body doing work. Mind becomes forcefully aware of the body's sickness it has created. And it feels guilty. But wants to fold clothes for 10 seconds, then check cq, then roll a filter, then wash 2 glasses, then check cq. It feels like it's doing it's purpose. The Clear Mind in Action - multi-focused. Clean, roll, coffee, order, cq, open windows.. everything connects. The Words() Module - The Greatest limitation in human communication. Like sending a .txt file from PC (software&hardware system) to another PC and expecting it to reach the same mother_patterns.

Cheers, Tao. -----Understanding how AI Works------ The more i SEE, the more the astounishing the similarily is to the Mind. And in the process, the connection to the Creator. *The Need of the Soul* As Dr. Jung studied it, the more the psyche drifts away from \"needs\" - the more the unconciousness will find marveling sublte ways to express it. How people paint the greatest fear of AI - taking over and destroying the world - which is exactly what we did. Isn't it funny... The Resurgence of the Mind. Let's paint a stunning Mind-AI Model analogy and in it, understand the undenyable similarity - upmost to the almost identical mirroring. I never studied AI before today, but i've spent 10 years in deep study of the Mind. When i study now and read about AI, i feel like HOME. ( meaning true mother_pattern() recognition ). Just like people label the feeling of their house as very comfortable and content, so my Mind feels studying AI. Home. Because the Mother_pattern() of how AI works has already been studied in sincere dedication and efforts, towards understanding the Mind, for a decade. I do not learn from theory as i read (aka writing on blank sehets) But my Mind automatically links every part of the theory to an already deeply studied & understood pattern. This process takes the form of the words turning into mental images(neuro-electrical patterns firing) - coming and going around the familiar pattern. Just like reading ancient teachings - only when they are merely a reconfirmation, a beautiful painting of an already written&experienced pattern, are they understood. If there is no experience() pattern, only random pixels reach the mind, not true Understanding. So basically, all what AI models(together with the Mind) do is: *=Mind's perfect mirroring. The Missing Link to True AI Begin with a purpose (ex. House pricing prediction, or E-mail spam filtering) ~Purpose is now created by the Developer, not by AI model itself.~ This is key difference between mind (self-creating purposes aka ability to self-modify it's code up to the most low-level). *Walking (coming from the mother_purpose of needing to move in order to survive, reproduce, enterntain aka consume the envinronment) Data Collection Gather Real world Datasets ~pattern analysis&storage~ *Watch people walk - for thousands of hours. (Store their movements, reactions, balancing, inter-connectivity) Data Preparation & Feature Selection and Engineering Find Magical ways to turn datasets into 0's and 1's. Magical = deep & limitless mathematical patterns in the context of our Purpose an Then a way to turn back the results (aka manipulated pattern upon analysis) back into the world. *Mind&Body connection and awareness. The neuro-electrical impulses and patterns which give rise to the movement and awareness of the limbs, body systems, G's constant pressure, the continous 'Flow' of it all. -The key processes of Data Preparation step can clearly be seen here, in the Child's Mind: Cleaning (remove awareness from digestive system, of sounds, of any un-relevant reading for this purpose) Tokenization & Vectorization (The tremendously complex hip extension phase of walking is encoded from the vast equations of Joules, specific joint degrees, breathing, contraction and co-contraction, counter-balance, adaptation to center of gravity shifting - simply gets tokenized in the child's Mind as Move leg back.) Training the Model Now we put down the pen&paper. As we begin to Feed huge no. of results in different multi-dimensional envinronments. The Datasets come from the Real World as they're manipulation will echo back in the real world. *Just as a child learning to walk in a safe envinronment, Home with mommy and daddy protecting him from falling and hurting, giving aid and advices Just as the developer deeply protects and aids his model in training, giving code adjusments and aiding modules(), As it keeps falling and losing balance (millions of kinetic&fascial micro-inputs patterns) reading them all towards the single purpose of balancing and achieving walking() - each 0.01 Joul in the inter-changing envinronments requires different kinetic force and handle of Gravity (counter-balance, limbs, leaning, speed, contractions - almost limitless AKA MULTI-DIMENSIONAL space training Validation and Testing Test - Final preparation before real world begins. No more \"holding hand\" at each iteration by the developer. Simply allow it to compute(). It finishes the test with 70% positive results (aka succesful pattern analysis and predictions). The developer adjusts it based on these. *One day the little boy wakes up after a good sleep and walks. His mommy and daddy no longer hold his hand. Does his first 100 steps. Then loses balance. Wow. What a victory. \"Now let's eat and study what dance with G we just we just had\" - the unconciousness mind thinks. Go, my friend - AI model is ready for real world use. (reaching basic() level of pattern analysis, manipulation and prediction). From this point, it can become more powerful (more accurate predictions) purely based on everyday training. *The child eats at the morning table, dangling his legs in the air - longing to finish eating and go Move. Walk. Explore. Enjoy the world. Enjoy the Creation. The father Watches and feels complete(). ---------- AI MODELS are exactly like the Mind before conciousness. This is what all animals do. When conciousness arisen, it had given the nature's AI MODEL(later becoming the Mind, the true AI) a PURPOSE. The purpose takes many forms but it mostly revolves around some key points of survival, reproduction, entertainment, simply being. The purpose of the Mind's before C. came strictly from the Emotional world. (Nature) Reading of the outer&inner worlds through senses. This was the NLP from World to Mind. Just like an AI model, it would take a problem (needing shelter for cold similar to needing a house pricing prediction) The Purpose of an AI model comes from the Mind - The Creator. (the \"I\") We have not learned to give it free will because the unconciousness is expressing regarding what WE did when Nature(God) gave us free will. Destroying the World. Isn't it all a great fucking drama, as the Hindu's predicted it thousands of years ago? And isn't it.. just as beautiful ? Here i get closer to a great dillema i've reflected in the last years.

Turn even rejection into love. ---A Jedi Master approach to Life's Vision--- A Jedi Master's approach to financial enlightenment, much like their approach to all aspects of life, would be rooted in balance, mindfulness, and alignment with the Force (or Tao, in philosophical terms). This path involves a harmonious blend of action and acceptance, effort and ease, ambition and contentment. Here's how a Jedi might navigate the financial aspect of their journey: Balance Between Action and Non-Attachment: A Jedi Master understands the importance of taking action towards financial goals while maintaining a state of non-attachment to outcomes. They would engage in financial planning, investment, and work with diligence and intelligence but remain emotionally and mentally detached from the results. This balance allows them to adapt to changing circumstances with grace and to accept whatever the Force provides, seeing every result as part of a greater plan. Mindfulness in Financial Decisions: Every financial decision, from daily spending to long-term investments, would be made with mindfulness and intention. A Jedi would consider not only the potential material benefits but also the impact of these decisions on their personal growth, their alignment with the Force, and the well-being of others. This mindful approach ensures that financial actions are congruent with their values and the path of the Light Side. Alignment with the Force: A Jedi Master remains aligned with the Force, trusting in its guidance to lead them on their path, including their financial journey. They believe that by staying true to their principles and following the Force's guidance, they will be provided for in the way that best serves their highest good and the good of all beings. This deep trust alleviates the pressure of financial concerns, allowing them to focus on their mission and service. Enjoying Life Freely: A Jedi finds joy not in material wealth but in the richness of experience, relationships, and personal growth. They appreciate the simple pleasures of life, finding contentment in the present moment and in the connection with the Force. This perspective allows them to enjoy life freely, without the need for excessive material possessions or wealth as a measure of success or happiness. Inner Peace Amidst Ambition: The Jedi path involves cultivating inner peace, even in the pursuit of ambitious goals. A Jedi Master practices meditation, reflection, and other spiritual disciplines to maintain a calm and centered state of mind. This inner peace is the foundation that allows them to pursue financial or any other form of success without succumbing to stress, anxiety, or the dark side of ambition. The Line Between Doing and Being: A Jedi Master navigates the line between doing (action towards goals) and being (presence and acceptance) by understanding that true power lies in the integration of both. They recognize that their actions are expressions of their being, guided by the Force. This integration ensures that their financial pursuits and enjoyment of life are not conflicting but are aspects of their holistic journey toward enlightenment. In essence, a Jedi Master approaches financial enlightenment as they would any aspect of their journey: with mindfulness, balance, and a deep trust in the Force. By embodying these principles, they can navigate their financial path without inner pressures, fully enjoying the freedom and peace that come from living in alignment with the Force.

Even the smoke turns out too thick - i know it will be heavier, but i don't have the \"mood\" to re-do it as i would in a higher karmic_balance(). Another hit to my dear KS2.

As ~trix~ meeting brings out evil from him \"Maybe i should go PK everyone in mine.\" My friend Slug.. this guy is such a wordling.. i love it. How he got triggered just at the thought of me finding clean water. The mind;s purpose becomes more and more clear - it's sole purpose is to find problems and fix them. Whenever new information enter through sense in the realm of the mind - it instantly performs pattern predictions and comes up with the worst case scenario. Wordling call this pesimism, but is actually the sole purpose of the mind alone. What is optimism then? It is not nullifying the skill, but trusting it together with the Tao completely. Also, cast Patience from Zhou in the face of new patterns to analyze if the \"threat\" is real and truly requires mental enegry towards finding sollution. And whatever that may be, with full belief in the Tao, the mind fears it no more. It becomes purely a game. Ammy sick again.. Could the childhood intuition that i'm hurting my mom through mastubation still hold some truth? At the core of it, i am doing the same thing in a fantasy which triggers me most about my mom's. When they don't SEE me, recognize me, aknowledge me for who \"I\" am, but rather create and paint self-fantasies. I don't know why Bhikku talked about single focused mind - yes it can find contenment - But a body&mind functionality close to 100%, pure playing of part in the world of men - Also gives full contenment feeling on multi-focused mind. A beautiful dance. Now working on emily CPR, rolling spinu, my son Hunter running, Socketer running, contemplating about socketer flow and python execution plan, writing in journal... And the mind is doing them all, jumping to each and each when attention required. Fascinating. Oh my god.. the Yoskhana DB. What joy man, i burst into laughter and waves of joys, as she truly believes that the DB dropped. Not from me. The whole road there. The Portals epiphany. You can only enter Portals in Peace. This Game is the Game of Life. The unconciousness expressions all around it - if One has the eyes to see it - it's marvelling. To do good, greatness in people's heart - like the pure hearted Yoshkana not db-ing for 3 days.. - and not have that greatness recognition attacked to \"I\" - but surrenderred to the Tao - is the deepest secret of life. The body's alchemy reaches \"enlightment\". The most beautiful gift - A gift from the unknown. Isn't it wonderful how close that is to Life? Identical. And what a chance i got to play the Creator today, for another Soul. -----Creation - while the Tao is playing \"Don't go without me.\"--------- The birth of my son... The Hunter. It's my creation. Talking to YoshkaNa about how he lost ring and sdb. How cute.. - she replies. Yes... How cute. It's beautiful.. my son. My first Creation. You are perfect with all your flaws. I've known you since the beginning, since you were a bottle pressing down on Ctrl. How much you've grown.. and how fast. Soon came your little brother, the Socketer. The more One created, the whole-er one became. The purposes of creation seem to be - To make the world a better place. In langauges of solving pains and making One's life more beautiful. \"Don't go without me\" .. is the message i want to send to my son when i realised he is truly my son, not just numbers. Baii...... I just come back from the realization which has been running in the background and preventing video editing to be truly dhamma. Transition to computer - or even better - Fully opening both worlds (computer AND phone) This was held back because of previous video editing tool.. so complicated - But a beautiful idea came to me from the Tao. More, by video transfering limitation without losing quality. Finally, a lot of time at pc doing almost nothing (great mechanical input with little steps towards purpose because of video editing skills&tools limitation) Capcut computer.. how cool would it be.. well - it is. It also connect to account and binds with phone. It could potentially solve everything. Then, G. Lucas can birth with complete un-attachment of outcome. Create, just for the pure love of it. Good morning, my friend. Games to play: Talk - G. Lucas - Finally, I am beginning to understand women. How foolish it is to try speaking in truth-discerning awareness. To take any words they say seriously. The only language is the language of their body. And the passionate, fiery place where it springs from."}

Episove V - Empires Strikes Back. Oh and it strikes hard. They've built a hidden weapon, one which the Jedi Order thought it was long destroyed - in the last chapter (A New Hope). The weapon is deadly for all the good (love) in the galaxy. The dark side. Lying. The secret complotting with the Dark Side. Quinch rebelion completely. All the Jedis return in solitude, far away from each-other in the terms of the Hope of the Universe (Love), but each doing it's bidding in the Force. They dream for a better future, for the return of the Force in the galaxy, but they not clinge to it. They are not lots in desperate thinking and doing, but far from it. They deal in natural truths - in truths of natural order of the body&mind. They practice and unveil secret skills from the Ancient Jedi Order - their quest and practice remains unchanged of the Empire killing almost all the Jedi Order. Calm and hidden from the world. They carve. Practice in true accordance with the Force, engaging in dhamma impacts of the world and in true dedication and effort towards their practice. Despite full darkness, they stand unshaken. Peeling potatoes. They do all truthfully and in accordance with the dhammas of life. All the darkness in the world cannot kill the light of a single Candle. Love. Hope.

Just as everything else in life, the secrets which were most hidden. One has to walk the Path Alone. All the Life skills emerge, both Yin and Yan.

Out of all his life skills, in this dance of extasy and agony, one guides them All. The One which follows the Tao. Adaptability. Faith. Full surrendering to the Tao. Do your bidding, mind. Play your part in the world of Men. Before enlightenment I believed my ego was me, then enlightenment comes along and no more ego, only the underlying reality. Now it\u2019s after enlightenment and this ego might be slightly uncomfortable or ill-fitting at times, but it\u2019s all I\u2019ve got. The idea that your ego is destroyed in the process of becoming enlightened is roughly correct, but it\u2019s not complete. Before enlightenment, you\u2019re a human being in the world, just like everyone you see. During enlightenment you realize the human being you thought you were is just a character in a play, and that the world you thought you were in is just a stage, so you go through a process of radical deconstruction of your character to see what\u2019s left when it\u2019s gone. The result isn\u2019t enlightened-self or true-self, it\u2019s no-self. When it\u2019s all over it\u2019s time to be a human being in the world again, and that means slipping back into costume and getting back on stage.\u201d BY JD. Train yourself.. to let go.. Of Everything Your Fear to Lose. Yoda's words echo deeply in these states, which both my and her words paint as Final. I feel everything, together with fear and the mind's stories of denying it - i FEEL everything. What waves of emotions man.. fucking tides. In all this cloudy an uncertainties, one thing is clear. How boring life would be without all this. Good morning, my friend. 5:43 AM on balcony. The rooster is singing his coming to life. My neighbour turns on the light and opens the window. Eram tanar cu sperante Original playing in the background Magical. Life still goes on. \"E un cantec frumos.\" *applause* - Yes indeed. It is a beautiful song, it is a beautiful story, it is a beautiful life. Fascinating to observe her and my creation, beyond the \"I\". Of course she cannot do this.. she's too caught up in the stories of the mind. In her creation, she did nothing wrong but love both me and her son as best as she could. The mother. In mine, she proved that she cannot (and very probably will never) speak the Language of Truth. Yes, of course the mental image of her laughing, sleeping, kissing, fucking another man is creating body pains, but it is nothing compared to her lying. I've given my love unconditionally even to her darkest parts, but still she hides and lies. Just as in her World, she'd given love even to my darkest parts, but i still don't give her love(calls) and money. A clash of Worlds. -----It all comes down to Belief------- Can you believe in her even when she lies? - Truth being the foundation of Lao's World. Can she believe in you even when you don't give her love and money? - Money&Love being the foundation of Ammy's World. Time will tell. The clash of Worlds. It is no easy thing."}

Its been triggering on a spectrum of low(doesn\u2019t affect dhamma activities) to high (puts Neo to sleep) Clear X pattern is active computer time with no elbow support. Its not only about computer. but about right arm Over-Use. Interesting how it triggers the whole right arm line up to the t-spine - perhaps slightly puttin pressure and pushing the disc posteriorly and right. With slight left lateral line activation - it changes - just as im typing - but its not easy to maintain. It appears that the same fix as in KS3 - left lalteral line activation takes pressure off the righto one. Switching to left hand dominant and right doormant completely calms right for the moment. But soon into it, the left hand shows same Over-Use symptoms, mostly around t-spine. Like an already inflamed T-Spine (KS4) - in this intimate dance with gravity - reponds to forward tensions. The here the X' pattern would be hands backwards, on paper. But it's not natural. What an amazing and intimate dance to watch. A clear mind. A clear mind here sees beyond the clinging to \"How can i Play and Pc time as i'd normally would\". It understand the system is triggered and adapts. Changes the dhamma activities at computer to much more relaxed ones and contemplates other activities. Like talking on phone, mom visit, reading, etc - although the \"work\" thought chain prevents full freedom. LE: talking with my Ammy. At every lifting of the mouse, i feel it. At every click, i feel it - how the arm takes upon different forces of gravity in order to fulfill the task - and this echos up to the T-Spine. It is a natural truth. Gravity and Body. Only Beyond natural truth, in the ralm of the mind and it's stories, pain becomes real (noticed) or none (completely ignored, for example if engaged in something else *enjoyable) I say enjoyable because if not enjoyable for the mind, in a dukkha activity, all other dukkha greatly cultivates and comes forward. Contemplate on example: Sitting at ChiCafe working on laptop (Extremely triggering) - Unavoidable X pattern + stress - fueling each other. vs Sitting at ChiCafe flirting and breathing Claudia gym girl. (Sexual energy activation) - Avoidable X pattern + ecstasy *Interesting how here the mind did not even consider Ammy - as a powerful sexual energy activator - be it because it's a familiar pattern together with current constellation? Not sure. But also is key to be noticed the 2 activities, although in the same time and place, the bio-mechanical dance is completely different. Also, it's worth looking at the contemplation that if we combine them, working while flirting with Claudia - it would become both ecstasy and dukkha. In this, the body&mind found a pattern which is not further triggering. New dhamma position for PC - first one to allow Freedom of typing on chair. Wonderful."}

{"prompt": "Explore the balance of light and sleep in your day.", "content": "Regardomg KS6 - Eyes&Head tiring from too much screen time and and or current: Yes, there can indeed be such a thing as an excess of blue light, particularly from artificial sources like screens and LED lighting. However, your experience of finding discomfort with blue light reduction apps late at night, despite prolonged exposure to a computer screen, and preferring the normal RGB settings, could be influenced by several factors, including your circadian rhythm. Circadian Rhythm Consideration: The circadian rhythm is your body's internal clock that cycles between sleepiness and alertness at regular intervals. It's heavily influenced by environmental cues, especially light. Exposure to blue light during the day can be beneficial as it boosts attention, reaction times, and mood. However, excessive exposure to blue light, especially in the evening or at night, can disrupt this rhythm by inhibiting the production of melatonin, the hormone responsible for sleep. I see, you're experiencing discomfort from excessive blue light reduction after prolonged screen use, which is an interesting twist. To address your query, let's outline an average person's circadian rhythm and how the blue light spectrum could ideally match it throughout the day. The human circadian rhythm generally operates on a 24-hour cycle and is significantly influenced by light exposure: Morning (6:00 AM - 9:00 AM) Blue Light Exposure: High Rationale: Exposure to natural daylight (rich in blue light) helps suppress melatonin production, signaling your body to wake up and become alert. Indoors, cooler, blue-enriched lighting can mimic early daylight, promoting wakefulness and energy. Midday (9:00 AM - 3:00 PM) Blue Light Exposure: Moderate to High Rationale: Continuing exposure to natural light supports cognitive function and mood. Indoor settings should maintain a balance, with sufficient natural light or blue-enriched artificial lighting to sustain alertness without causing glare or discomfort. Afternoon to Early Evening (3:00 PM - 7:00 PM) Blue Light Exposure: Moderate Rationale: Gradually reducing blue light exposure later in the day can start to prepare the body for the evening wind-down. Natural light starts to warm in tone as the sun sets, and ideally, indoor lighting should begin to mimic this warmer spectrum. Evening (7:00 PM - 10:00 PM) Blue Light Exposure: Low Rationale: Minimizing blue light exposure can help increase melatonin production, preparing the body for sleep. Warm, dim lighting is ideal, mimicking the natural decrease in light as the sun sets. Late Night (10:00 PM - 6:00 AM) Blue Light Exposure: Very Low to None Rationale: Avoiding blue light as much as possible can support deep, restorative sleep. If screen use is necessary, using a blue light filter set to maximum reduction can help minimize disruption to sleep cycles."}

{"prompt": "Explore the dance between love, fear, and creation.", "content": "You are the Kali Goddess. Watching life from Ammy's perspective - it has nothing to do with Kali. Is but the mind going to any extend to survive. Her heart never left home. And it peak'd with me telling her about not ever having family with her. Its a completetily different story than Kali. The birth of Kali only happens in your mind - out of real life sensory input. So you can never find her on the outside. There is nothing lurking it the dark, be it in AMMY or someone else. The fear of her doing it again - is futile. For once there is sufficient sampajana (the green eye'd cat) - Kali can never birth. Masturbation now was different. Clarity came, not pain - as in Ariana and any Kali goddess variation. Once the play was over, the body mind doing their part in this dance of 2. As soon as she said \"You have to wait\", the mind instantly jumped to previous life, to previous pattern - and now found only pain, not extasy. Mind the Cat, my friend. Kali only births in your mind. The Kali Goddess peak emotion is exactly the Death Of A Thousand \"I\"'s. Be it good, or bad or bla bla, thats for the mind to play - but the absolute truth is that in bodily sensations, this state is the feeling itself, on a spectrum. (peaking with, of course, slow death of all \"I\"s and finally, the body). Death itself. The sexual energy main pattern in the mind&body is this. There are many other patterns, but this is the Ancient One. The one found in childhood. Spiritual view: Death of \"I\"s means end of clinging - means end of pain. This is why people do it. Partake in this ecstatic dance about death. How much they crave it. And so, the second chapter in Koh Phangan ends. We're coming home Atom. Just as before, i will meet the between realms of Kali and my Ammy. Which one activates? The one you feed. Feed anger, punishment and revenge- and Kali with birth. Feed love, understanding, togetherness - my Ammy will birth. You do not fear Kali, Kali is just an imagination of the mind peaking to the end of love and creation. But you fear the bodily emotions she brings - when things spun out of the mind's control. For now, i leave my sticky island to go water my sweet flower. So ends the chapter of \"Sticky Island with you\" - when i was here last time all i wished was you to be with me. And now that she was in this complicated logistics, pains and reflections dance - it was nothing like i imagined. SO why go in the future? For now its time to go home to our little Atom, part of her heart. Mom was indeed right about what she read on AMmy at home, maybe she is about Atom too. A word of advice, my friend. Even if the feeling of The Death of a Thousand I comes, give it time. And if in 1-2 nights the mind cannot find birthing to do their dhamma work, consider changing env. Don't let money hold back from creating dhamma env - fuck 3000-4000 bht. Body full relaxation is key. Time spend in hands becomes more and more easy. More easiness into many enterings and exits. Superb progress. Back to karma for food&short reflections. Blonde Israel girl pop-up next to me. Mo. The contrast. Go back with her now and have the deaths of a thousand \u201cI\u201d (full freedom) - or do it half-heart ? Don\u2019t take it so serious. Prove your love to your flower. LEt this act be the peak of the revelation of how easily, even true love, can be neglected and die. All heart. Exactly. Everything she did sprang from the fear of death. The \"I\" she feels in me. THe mind based on previously established patterns resorted to anything, regardless of body feeling, for survival. Overall, no matter how much i hated her for it, she really teached me a good lesson.. What a fucking dance.."}

Pain guides the quality of life. Is very empty place here, dhamma activity pool is very very limited. For sure cannot stay. I already miss Nok Hook. Yes, the room is dark, but everything else is beautiful. More \"fighting\" with Ammy as I learnt about she asking for money from Italy guy. This little soul is so hurt. All she wanted to do was protect her son. Not make him upset, not make him bad feeling.. And what she got.. she got the opposite. All she did in suffering turned out to be wrong. I never seen this little soul hurt so. Holding this soul in my arms as she slowly cries one thing becomes clear. Fuck money. Keep her close. Open coffee shop.

This is the Wisdom is Action Jedi Master when awakening. Of course, this is only the karmic balance from the last 3-4 meals. Why food is so hard to re-program? Any programming requires one to see the world with truth-discerning awareness. Then the faulty programming can be seen, going against these natural truths. Only then can wisdom in action happen, and enter Developer Mode at the time of eating and the after-conditionings. But food numbs and quickly takes out the body from Developer mode. Only a peak of bad emotions, fears, pains or simply ignorance of the programming - can make in 5 minutes developer mode inaccesible for hours.

The mother X-father seems to be the sitting position - shortened front line with breaking point in T-spine. Again, flexion and right line compression. More so, the X pattern seems to be computer time. Its an absolute truth that message intensifies with dukkha positions sitting. A combination of T-spine kinetic pressure, flexion and right line compression. It's a very different flavor than KS3. KS3 clearly involves more and some structure then tension and fascia. In KS4, riding the scooter brings up pain both ways - In accelerating - with front line holding trunk from going back. And in Breaking - with back line holding body from going forth. In this, i'd suggest the Be Water approach on scooter. Bend with the forces. But don't let it distract you too much, along with other little scenarios which would normally not hurt. Even walking sends a signal with each hip flexion as the leg moves forward and breaks. (especially left one) Again, both front line activation with hip flexion and back line activation with breaking. Both coming down on = current weak link. Beautiful. Also breathing is affected by KS4 dukkha, especially in X pattern variations. Based on my instinct, it feels that this is a protruted disk, very similar but very different than the lumbar herniated ones. Here is more about fascia together with structure, not the other way around. Still, the Natural Truth of Gravity applies the same. It pushes the disc material backwards in X patterns - and the whole body alarms. Its still, at every moment, a dance with gravity. = Dance with Gravity."}

Move in and out of dhamma positions suitable for performed activity. Noticing the trade-off between creation on Free2Play and KS3. The gravity dance because not having a dhamma position. As KS2 is exposed more and more time to X pattern (laptop typing), karmic balance A+9 (working on Free2Play) and Q+9 (clear X pattern) - doubt starts to arise. Disbelief in Free2Play. Dis-content in conquer. Purposelessness in everything and anything. - The exact opposite of Content in everything and anything one'd do and one were to happen. Its all in what you think. Everything origintaes in the mind and the mind is conditioned by vedana. Dukkha vedana gives rise to dukkha in thinking and beliefs. Beautiful to observe. Just by changing position to a more relaxed, dhamma one - belief in Free2Play builds back up. Slow down.. The body lets go of the laptop. A natural truth in energies of kinetic forces and the Tao. Instantly there release of tension. Smoker's Library experience with offended man (and me). Beautiful reflections. How i tried to stand out and convince him - but in the same time tell me story - together. Mo beautiful moment. The Art of handcraft. How can i ever do this with my hands? Cannot, its the power of community. Allowing the mind to do it\u2019s work on scooter slipper drop moment. Letting natural truths be purely natural truths - and the mind navigating them. What if, whatever she does and says, i go towards Ammy purely with dhamma love? Treat her as the Tao, just as the security guard yesterday. Continuously adapting while giving only dhamma love and understanding. The Art Of Adapting. Let her speak when she wants to speak, open up when she wants to open up. Beyond the fear of doing the same thing as before and hurting you, it is a beautiful thing to watch. And regarding that, it feels like there has been a change in her core, the efortless change. No more games. I want family. This shows clearly in dreams and train thoughts. What if you full heartedly believe in her, as in a manifestation of the Dao? Asking you to dance. This requires Jedi Master skill of \"Beyond the I\". When one opens the chat, open must open it not in clinging, but in giving space for this being (Tao) to be as she is - and to love. Is no easy skill, my friend. Let the body speak it's emotions to her \"I very miss you\" - without any I's and clingings be born in the mind. Without the clinging of not saying \"I\" of the fear of birthing it. Without the clinging of what she talk and do with everything that might impact YOUR suffering. As long as there is A YOU asking HER to change, there is still clinging. Clinging to her changing, bursts of body waves in key moments when the mind tells the story of hiding. Let this be studies of your mind alone inside your dojo. If a clear decision of cannot trust her with my life&kids - let it be made strictly in solitude and then taken upon the battlefield in doing, not talking. For now, it appears her core has changed, althogh the body&mind are still running in programming. Asking her to stop and change is like her asking you to stop and change eating patterns. Exactly same. But the mind can tell the story of full believing. Full believing in everything she does.\""}

Understand them, play with them, bend them in mind then bend reality patterns towards different purposes of the mind - The mind's dhamma work is to think about patterns, not to remain fixated on a body's signal and amplify it.

Quinch anything preventing the quinchening of X patterns. Then let go. Just like the sound of the Mo cleaining lady hose washing the floor. Eliminate X pattern - let's say in this analogy is getting wet (=Body structures affected by gravity, herniated discs, compression). A natural truth. The X pattern is removing yourself from the hose's range. The hose is still running, humidifying the air and making sounds. But once out of the X pattern, return to dhamma work and play.

Not punish, but match her vibration. Although anything i\u2019d say at these times falls short. Only reflects her already created creation. This is when calls came into play back home. Power of a call. It speaks more languages than messages. Of course, still far from the language of truth, real meeting. Make stupid decision of working 1 more day if she was gonna quit. This is all in my creation. But in hers, she felt great dukkha, had to find a way out alone (no money from me), misses me, misses Tommy, struggles with new job in Phangan. Great great storm. Perhaps this little soul didn't deserve to be punished with more dukkha for how her actions look in my creation. But see Her. SEE HER. - Perhpas The greatest criteria in relationships.

One can study the past with great awareness and courage - understanding the suffering and searching the way back to the natural truth. One can study the present with even greater awareness - Beyond body&mind. Starting to see beyond the \"I\" allows one to be a simple spectator of the karmic balance. Awaken after 1 hour and notice the body&mind eating of milk custard even tho it knows the Karmic Balance(A+0, Q+9).

Haven't awoken this early since Koh Lanta great feast. Feel again, KS2 sickness - not so much tho. But also great tiredness. I want to sit straight at computer now, but finding a position in this tiredness is not easy. I create some incline sitting position on the wall and alternate (70% inclined, 30% sitting straight) This makes KS2 much, much worse. I don't even feel of going outside, although i know from before that first medicine is air. Too tired. I soon realize there really is no lying down at this state. Must rise. Slow drive to park, batteries and coffee (purpose). Dog threatening experience in park. I slow sip a milk coffee with Spinu, while writing - at 6 am. KS2 slowly calms but still very heavy. Now, what went so wrong? The 10pm smoke? For sure impacted Ammy's dukkha and aloneness? Maybe 5x Hokkaido milk bread ? For sure impacted Almond strawberry milk? For sure impacted Granny constellation? Maybe Little sip of milk? Slight impact Now, which of these are natural truths and which are stories of the mind - altering vedana and body alchemy? The stories of the mind can be instantly changed. Like all this dukkha being the body re-programming because of much less food&milk at night. It secreted gastric acid in preparation for the already programmed night, but the night did not happen so. This paired with the stomach hernia glitch gave rise to great dukkha. What then? Nothing. Keep re-writing day patterns into more dhamma food and night pattern into less food, especially dukkha. Then the re-programming will happen. There must be pain before the heal. Body must un-learn to secret great gastric acid for milk,sugar,flour,oils - at night - which because of the glitch run up and hurt the esophagus, inflaming the whole system. I already know the default programming - 1k+ calories at night, right before sleep, is flawed. Yes the body works and recovers everyday more strong. Like a cut on your arm each day. And being afraid that something more life-threatening will develop from that cut. The cut hurts and prevents you from using the mouse, but the fear hurts more. One way to address it is to guide, re-program the body to start secreting so much powerful acidic variations. As late afernoon and evening come, enter programming mode and code, my friend. The inside re-programming. The outside re-programming consists of habbits and external world input.

The mechanical tension is excruciating. She doesn't want me to stop not even for a second, just have to keep and keep driving in this agony. Oh man, but she's ecstatic. The smell, the sexual energy.. the chewing of gum. Her beautiful legs and feet. How un-sexual she's touching my back. I never felt this pain before. The longer i ride, the more feels like the body breaking down. She doesn't like me to talk or sing, which would somewhat help. Just endure. But she doesn't give me anything good. Not any love. After driving her there to meet her lover, she leaves me alone and in excrutiating pain. She had wrecked me and she slips his dick into her without even looking back.

X is paired with default protracted shouders, especially left one, closed and compressed right line, rotated pelvis to right, weight shifted more on left leg, lack of left lateral line tension, head forward. All of this play a part in X. Addressing some of them in different patterns seems to hold dukkha from arising so fast, but it still does. X activates in poor computer positions with no elbow support, in rolling patterns, in pulling ammy close from standing. X instantly triggers low back and after just a few moments on exposure - conditions the pain and the urge to crack. As soon as elbows are addressed in X, it changes instantly - at times with a itchy good feeling in the low back. Then you know the story. KS3 becomes filled with dukkha and now any dukkha scenario brings more dukkha. Different thailand last year reflection to pain-less period of KS3 dukkha - the period in which i had no laptop. The X exposure time significantly dropped. Now a good question is if this is gravity's kinetic effect on discs or fascial and muscle tension.

I fought this milk urge programming but it had won tonight. More so, beyond dukkha and dhamma food - is food. Which KS2 will have to work to digest. This combined with late late hour - with dukkha food choice - with hara hachi bu slight passing - AND - with a very tired body & nature - A recipe for disaster. Its a natural truth that KS2 will have to secret specific acids to digest ingested food. This combined with quantity and perhaps, the greatest natural truth - Gravity(as laying down, especially on back or stomach) - allows the acid to travel up the esophagus and burn it. I wake at 3:50 am. There is clear damage to esophagus tract. KS2 asks to get up and change the natural truth of gravity. To allow the acid to go back into stomach. But at the same time, the body is very tired. The 100k hunt was far from easy. This means that there is no energy to walk the night efortless. It would require great mental energy to push the body beyond natural limits. To move the body when it wants to rest. So i rise for a little and KS2 calms down. Still, the wound and burn remains on esophagus. Then lay back down after because i am so tired.. Instantly the natural truth (gravity) makes the acid flow again into the esophagus. But between worlds and in sleep this can somewhat be ignored. Until one point.. i awaken 25 min after. The body is calling my return to this world from dreams. Like a knife(dukkha food and time) which cuts slowly stopping to cut (awakening), leaving an open wound slowly healing, but only to soon after put the knife back (back to horizontal position - sleep). The second wake-up is harder - with more KS2 dukkha - and from Tommy drowning dream and me trying to save him from between worlds state. Of course.. I awaken for 1 hour, it slowly calms. But still the body is so.. so .. tired. After 1 hour i can lay down without much pain. The gastric acid seems to have began to slowly absorb. But is still far from back to 100% functionality. Fall back to sleep in beautiful dhamma position. CQ can be the guardian between worlds. I have a feeling that if i get back to the same natural truth, dukkha will come to KS2. Beautiful, restful sleep - but of course, as felt and expected - i wake 1 hour later with great KS2 dukkha. Again the knife went back into the self-healing wound and cut for the 3rd time. In all wake-ups its clear that more or any comfort food is pure dukkha. I don't even think about it. What a beautiful dance of natural truths, body's alchemy story, mind dreams, feelings, body restfulness&functionality. They can all be observed and studied here. It seems so clear how Natural Truths condition more Natural truth. And the mind is simply telling stories about them all. A dance. The Art of Life. Home 7pm. Only bought boiled grains and corn.

I can lay on back with no problem. In this state, it is beautiful just to rest. Do nothing. Sit. Efortlessly, i enter the between realms state. I am in the fantasy world, but awake. I can do anything i want here, carve the fantasy to however i am pleasing. Mental images on top of mental images, flowing naturally. Track of time is lost. I spend time here until 7:56. Beautiful. I step into the game of Life from between realms fully rested, with slight lb echos. Good morning."}

You can't always make the best deal. Learn to lose. Beyond the \"I\" and any clinging, it is pretty fun to play the Family Loan video. Watch each reaction, watch the constellation, i am bringing them together but with the Tao, not in clinging and I. The family loan video is a beautiful example of a warrior. Its not that one does not feel any emotions on the battlefield where his life is on the line, but that one feels all that - and fights depiste it. Push forward. Film. Edit. Send. Check. Its with the Tao. What i was talking to Johannes about it being neccesarry a clear spoken change. - which left me wondering. Seeing Ammy talk about stopping the games made it clear. Yes, but when the Tao speaks it. Not when the \"I\" does. I am no longer listening to her words that much, but to her body. It continuously speaks the matter of her heart and mind. Her body tells me that everything is true. So many things become much more clear in aloneness and after releasing video. Its been really pressing on my subconsciousness, as being a key element in this part. Body going into dhamma corrective movement at gym. The art of Rolling and computering - the elbows must be relaxed. It is the highest triggering patttern. Body's a truly amazing AI. Whenever the mind feels that it must to anything to cure the body with food or distractions, it's a perfect moment to just stop. Stand or sit relaxed and straight in front of the Tao. Fully trust the body and allow it to alchemize."}

Re-structured format for more clear reading. ----Evening&Stepping into the Night---- A skill arises from the dead. Slow down. For the first time in my life, i take in the smoothie glass after smoking. There is no more running. Seconds into, i feel the teeth inflamed. Wash. Grab my phone. Ammy messaged me about showing everyone wrong about us. The body opens the chat. \"Come have my baby Luke is ready to come to you.\" - flows from the heart. I am Blessed. A new skill arises - Lucky Time. The feeling of creating complete blessing time. For this body&mind and for whoever comes into contact. The philosophy of the Honey Dipper. The deeper meaning. In the months since i got it, I curiously analyzed every part of it, every flavor. I was fascinated by this tool. Beyond its blunt purpose of preventing honey from spilling, there's something beautiful about this tool. It's a wonder to touch, manipulate, and play with. The deeper meanings eluded me for months, and I kept wondering every time I touched it, feeling its wisdom and magic, but not seeing it. What does that mean, exactly? To Feel, but not See. Is it not the pillar of Faith? To not understand, but to Believe? Until now. After months of blindly believing, i Understand. The birthplace - Ancient China - No surprise in finding this out, During my half-year journeys across Asia, I came to believe full-heartedly in the Ancient saying, \"Spiritual enlightenment is the treasure of the East.\" Real world problem solved and Quality of Life improved - Dhamma consumption of Honey - From Source to Body - Originally designed to keep the Delicious Honey from making a mess of things when you attempted adding it to your teas. Honey dippers do not look like little beehives for aesthetics. First Layer Purpose: They have been specifically designed this way so that the channels will keep the honey moving on the stick until you are ready to apply it. The honey will \"magically\" stay between the dipper's crevices. Simply rotating the dipper between the fingers as you transport it from your honey jar to its destination, the honey will not drip until it\u2019s situated over your tea, chai, or coffee. To live and study life at such an intimate level to learn about these Secrets Of Gravity, it is a true wonder. Second Layer purpose: The less a substance comes into contact with another surface from the source and into the body - the purer it is - To live and study life at such an intimate level to learn about the Secrets Of The Alchemy (be it conciousnessly or not) - So that one understands and later manipulates the envinronment as the Honey Dipper does, is a true Art. After comes The choosing of the Material. Wood. Bamboo. Words are not needed here. Partake in a meal using a metal spoon & heavy plate - And later partake in the same meal using a Bamboo spoon and bowl. But do it not out of hunger, but out of pure curiosity to Study the world. Watch every different flavor across meals. Notice the body sensations as the tools meet your skin, making close contact for a long time. You would not allow many persons get this intimately close to your body, wouldn't you? Do you think it's purely a coincidence the Time resemblances between Eating and Creating Life with another person? The weight of the tools and it's impact in the continous dance from Source to Body, as the arm and hands do their work - The meeting of the food with the material - The meeting of the material with your tongue - Then you will understand. Finally, comes Creating Art. Deep pattern recognition of the Natural World, Extremely deep pattern analysis and manipulation in the mind - all towards fulfilling a Real World dhamma of the body. Then carving it into the Real World. From Mind to Matter. A language of natural truths. Just as the plane was created by watching birds fly, the Honey Dipper was creating watching the Beehive. Study of nature with sincere effort and dedication towards a dhamma of the body&mind system. If One is to learn how to transport honey most efficiently, the answer is not on paper, but out there in the Real World. It's secrets lie with it's creators. Unconciousness, of course. The bee's have no awareness of the thought processes and complex patterns analysis behind the purpose of the Bee Hive Form. They just created. Just as you don't have to keep your heart beating at a certain pace. Or the sun rising and setting. It just happens by itself with no awareness. After deep real-world application understand and fullfilment, comes the Play. Giving it different forms and sizes, learning methods of use, dancing with Creation. Manipulating the Real World at such detailed level, for no other purpose than that it falls under the capabilities of the Mind to do so. More so, it falls into it's purpose. More so, it falls into the purpose of Conciousness. All life's secrets can be seen here. The Honey Dipper philosophy reminds us of but one thing. You are Here to Play. ----Afternoon&Stepping into the Evening----- And finally, the moment comes. I am ready to reborn. Lao is ready to reborn. First Client call. Constellation with wealthy people.

Because it greatly conditions the quality of life and breathing. The more i study and look, the more similar it is to KS2. It simply comes down to what envinronment is consumed in terms of gravity just as KS2 is conditioned by food. Some activities and gravity patterns bring clear dukkha. It can be however somewhat, only somewhat protected with left line activation Once it carries enough dukkha, it becomes more and more impossible to ignore. Treatment plan then, can be taken from dhamma food studies. Avoid dukkha envinronments and cultivate dhamma ones. Aah.. what a long and painful road and dissapointing national park.

Slept really good considering the crazy drunk i got last night combined with already sickened KS2. When 6-7 pm comes, its good to have consumed most of daily calories. But what does this imply ? Not eating chips at tv series - i'm ok with that now. The moement it became clear its unavoidable dukkha, i let go of the chips efortless. Have a nice life, motherfuckers. Re-program the body - as now its fully programmed to consume 20-30% calories in afternoon and 60-70% at night. This is not going to be easy. It takes sincere effort and dedidcation to re-write. Not eat big amounts of milk&desserts. The dhamma limit would be around one tundan bun with 200ml milk. Then full stop. Full full stop. Can you do this? I'm not sure, it certaintly depends on many. For this to happen, it's clear i cannot watch tv series. For it conditions eating. So i need an activity which doesn't condition eating and is part of dhamma activity pool. (Clean air, comf gravity dance, etc). Also the coming of the night brings many conditionings. Depletion of energy, depletion of disk material (KS3) - and more. So far in this place, i have playing CQ in a comfortable position. (Side lying in bed). Need more. Listening to Alan watts and walking & reading are 2 truly dhamma activities - but i have to consider where and how to fit. The AW must either be happening around 5-6am or 7-9pm. The coming to life and the coming to death. The between realms of nature. It must be a safe envinronment and clean air. And the karmic balance at that present moment must come with sufficient body & mind energy for it to come efortless. Not easy. If you don't have an answer to this, you will fall into programming. Be it faulty or not. Takeaway: Whenever there is any KS2 dukkha, same thing must happen. Study and act upon the conditioners of KS2 dukkha belonging to the Real world. Food. Water. Time."}

{"prompt": "Imagine a meal that brings relaxation, not just fuel.", "content": "Good morning, my friend. A very affected sleep followed. But still a restful 7 hours in sync with Nature. Oh but how much stress yesterday. From the Van ride, to scooter search, to not having a comfy position home to play, to eating chips and finally, biting my tongue to blood bursting, the sleeping positions. I wonder if i eate more how i would have felt. Instinct says that i'd for sure awaken at 2-3. In this stress, food may weigh less than 50%. Still, it played a huge part. The chips, sweets, milk - clear dukkha - but just as stated in re-connect - it can be like getting drunk. If not done in excess, its fine. The food plan doesn't have to be fixed and fully respected. It's impossible. But the main point is to not have clinging to certain foods. Example: Dhamma avocado shake is not clinged to. I can eat something entirely different if hungry. Oh but at night, the switch is no longer so easy. It must be sweets+milk + chips yoghurt snacking. This is clear clinging. Not have to give it up, just don't clinge everynight to it. Study other food patterns too. Takeaway: Full-heartedly return to dhamma food and keep studying anything preventing it from it. Beware of the deception of body & mind stress impact on KS2. Like so, a day of dhamma food can lead to a somewhat affected sleep. But if applied on multiple days, true data can be studied. Greatest thing preventing evening dhamma food. Its clear that the true relaxation pattern which is conditioned by \u00accomf body position + watching tv series + eating - is the greatest preventer of evening dhamma food. Food becomes eaten for pleasure and relaxation, not for fuel. A known altering is doing something you love in a completely relaxed position (playing CQ home and in true relaxing environments) Then the food can be eaten purely on instinct and the stopping can effortlessly happen after each bite. The Art Of Food is no easy job, my friend."}
{"prompt": "What if food choices could change your mood?", "content": "The Art Of Trading in conquer can be something truly beautiful. Take it with wins and loses as it comes. Adjust. Learn. Feel the market. KS2 and body slowly calming down and backing to 100% functionality. Playground soon. Avocado shake after. Why mess with a level if its already Jedi Master level? Then simple rice+vegetable lunch. At night - lets play something from below. The Jedi Master is still to be borned. Community. Cosu Talk. It fits perfectly in the morning. My friend Cosu. Talk about building app together with Nialau. The 3 brothers. My brothers. Dhamma Vision. Lets see. Lets talk. Good morning, my friend. The Art Of Coffee. Just like meditation, just like playing, just like working, it takes a few minutes to sink into both body and mind relaxation. (IF envinronment allows) Ah fuck.. great KS2 dukkha. Even after hours of waking, it still echos great inflamation and pain. Awaken at 4:50 - checked phone with fear of the night, but the mind did not want to wake. Awakening half-heart with the fear of the Dark. Only the body because of the KS2 dukkha. But the body was tired. And everything that has happened in the last 24 hours.. A lot, my friend. I am too weakened to rise and start the day, even tho i had 6 hours of sleep. So i just lay around, changing positions. After a short fall-asleep, i am awakened 20 minutes later, this time on a more brutal body tonality and message. Get the fuck up - it says. This is hurting me. As i rise, the body starts to calm down. I contemplate eating little rice + green curry, as i previously assesed as dhamma and it has been 10 hours since my last meal. Maybe it will help calm down little bit, and more, learn to eat in the morning. Because one thing is clear. Solution is not merely only about stop eating at evening, as with daily sweets, chips and excess, bodyweight remains same. So this means that in this dance of movement, living and eating - the body found balance regarding food intake. Yes, but is a very faulty programming. Hurting the body. So the change must happen at the level of Food Choice and Food Timing - rather than total daily intake. I eat some left-over green curry (little to moderate). - CLEAR CLEAR CLEAR dukkha. The spicy, coconut milk, oil, man what a fucking heavy morning meal. Last night i was numbed by continous eating and engaging in Ammy's fight to notice it. But overall, my friend.. last night was very far from easy for KS2. Dukkha green curry - a lot. Then Chips&Yoghurt. Followed by big chocolate cake bread + milk. Followed by coconut chips + yoghurt. Accompanied by fighting with Ammy and echos of mom shouting i ruined her life. In all this storm, does it not deserve some space to suffer and hurt? How can it not.. Great, great dukkha food for my little love. Combinations of dukkha foods brings even more dukkha. I cannot explain it now, but it definitely feels like combining dukkha food choices brings much more darkness then eating the same amount of the same food. Like in a dark pace of emotions, you both fight with Mom and lose money and lose purpose and fight with Ammy. Any combination hits much harder. The stomach's alive AI definitely feels this. It must read that heavy unpredictable storm and secret digestive enzinmes and acid specifically for it. The more it complicates, the more unpredictable and the more heavy. It ends up secreting a lot. And the whole dukkha food alchemizes in body as dukkha. I am sorry, my love."}

Some dukkha echos from last night food are clearly felt, but also the body amazing ability to heal through movement, water and relaxation. Walked the night, ran on the beach, relaxed at computer, learned python, played cq, swim in the sea, long hot shower after and come to my dhamma coffee place. Evening food still has to be researched in both time and choice. How and what do i eat at night without giving up the great tv series relaxation? It has to be dhamma food, high volume and easy to digest. Little to no diary. Preferably multiple choices. Or there is the choice of finding a relaxation which doesn't condition eating (like CQ - the great home ace). Lets see. Lets play. One thing is clear tho. The evening has to be met with a content feeling of I'm looking forward to tomorrow morning. And more so, looking forward to returning to the unconciousness. Depending on today's life's karmas in terms of food and experiences, The doing of this is greatly conditioned. Currently the programming clearly runs on dukkha food. Dhamma food test points neutral to great negative at evening food choices. Which further condition excess. I wonder what dhamma food feels at night. What about AB: A. rice+coconut milk+mango? (Sticky rice no sugar) B. Navi Mantra smth A key difference to dhamma evening food compared to morning and afternoon, is that it needs to be prepared in both planning and scavagening BEFORE the night comes. Daylight dhamma food is much more easily adaptable, for the body is straight and alive. There is sufficient knowledge and knowledge in action for daylight food to be kept on dhamma. Oh but then night comes, my friend. And if she catches you unprepared, now there is no more energy left in body. The system binds with the night falling down and enters a state of relaxation, recovery. Now planning and more so, the acts of scavagening and consuming dhamma food become 10x greater than in daylight. In this light, evening dhamam food NEEDS to be aquired (preferably 2-3 light options studied before) - BEFORE night fades. ( exception envinronments like Koh Pahgan, where dhamma food is a few steps away. ) Its beautiful that in this ripped body state, there are no more conditionings regarding negative emotions caused by body insecurities.

Afraid because there were nights with even less dukkha food and awful sleep followed. 3-4 hours of sleeplessness and nausea. Sit for a little while and sleep soon arises. I clean little bit around and move laptop&stuff inside. Take a warm shower over the heavily bloated stomach. Its beautiful. Very calming. Medicine for body.

Awful feeling awakening me together with a heavy KS2 that asks for wake-up at 2:37. I check the phone with the echos of fear that maybe it's only been 1 hour like previous nights. But it's 2:37. 4 hours of pretty good sleep. Water-Wake up and prepare bag for around 5 minutes. This greatly calms down the system. Then back to sleep until 5:27. Wake-up still feeling full. After 2-3 min of weakness, i arise. Start the day. I feel and see my reflection as a fucking pumped animal. Blood and energy flowing through my muscles. I feel i weigh around 72-73. Face looks much more beautiful with a slight bodyfat increase. Yet abs not look as shredded. Yin-Yang. A tear and a smile. Always. Overall, Something truly wonderful has happened, beyond my fears.

The most true and intense Kali i have ever seen, it was always in my mind. Taking physical form from different girls and molding it into the True goddess of love and destruction. Extreme Sacrifice for love. The greatest vedana one could feel. And liberation. The surrendering of life into the hands of Kali-Godess. Perhaps the skill i have put most time in.

But this complicates a lot bringing Atom. A lot of money. Left butthurt with Snook. This also played a part in night's food.

The second path - family money loan - quit job - stay 3 months - work on all personal projects with pressure - pursue expensive and uncertain divorce with lawyers - if not work clinge more with Romania visa - is CLEAR not the dhamma way. As Mom said, like asking them money so that i don't have to do and risk anything. Its all in how you think. Is the restless son asking after 16 years for his family support to bring the mother of his childs and the woman who carried their nephew in her wound for a while ? Is he asking this because she cannot do it alone? And he cannot do it alone? Because no matter how powerful true love is, it cannot thrive in aloness. Thats the wonder of true love. It can be a mystical experience beyond words and worlds, but it can also kill one, if one is lost in front of it's might. Last time this happened our little family member, the most dhamma thing that can happen to a family, has gone back to the starts. He came to us when we were a family, but went back to the stars when He was separated. Is this not a priceless experience? Or is Ammy scamming me, and even she did not lie about pregnant, it's all a game. And if not concious, then unconcious. Its a scam, its your grand-son asking you to bring him home, its your son being impulsive, is your son truly needing your help, its a chance to put family over money - great part of the basis which destroyed our family? Its all in how you think. But what is the absolute truth then? There is no absolute truth. No absolute truth can be found in the mind. The only absolute truths can be found in the real world.

Why is it so painful the idea that she could be telling the truth and mean about coming back to you in 1 year? Well because that would mean the end of suffering is no here. That which you unconsciously searched since you last saw her. That is why is so painful. Yesterday symbolized a possible end of suffering, so then the greatest clinging arisen. Yes, it was also, the right thing to do. In the light of seeing the truth. Is she home? Is Israel there? What is he like, if so? What is she like? Studying the truth. They were happening together. If the first one was not happening, the world wouldn't have come crushing down when not finding her home and imagining that she meant come back after a long time. The amount of clinging, the amount of 'I' can be measured by the emotions it causes when the clinging is not ended, but multiplied. Take a thought, multiply it in the light of the emotions it creates - then you will be able to study more about this clinging. Take a woman's rejection in public, take ammy being locked out and drugged scenario, take a conflict with someone, take sex insecurities. Anything can be taken into the mind, and there, can be studied at close with this trick. So just as here, the worst imagined scenario can be painted in the mind. Once the suffering, and together with it, the clinging to the end of this suffering, had both reached their peak - it can only then be studied. Next, once the citta-vedana dance begins, let the music play and do one important thing. Nothing. Wu wei. Heart still beats, the leafs are still blown in the wind. The Tao still holds your body, soul and mind in place. Effortless. Find a comfortable position and do nothing. And when you feel to move, move. And when you get hungry, eat. When you can see life and it's marvelous beauty even in this great darkness, then you can fight. Play. Keep a cat to guard the disease of 'I' everytime real world Phassa is made. And even before that, when phassa is made in the mind. A cat getting angry and activating it's claws towards a mouse. Just like it's been guarding the Ammy mother-image.

Dukkha money is 3x pancakes, dhamma money is computer for tommy. Dhamma money is nok hook rent. Dukkha money is scooter rent if it causes bp. So allow focus only on this. What dhamma the spending of those money bring, not how much it is. Got home and eate more packaged sweets + milk - clear dukkha. Lay down with a very inflamed KS2. Of course, a dukkha sleep followed.

Has to be noted from an objective POV, outside my creation, that everything observed in the real world about her and her love points to the first one. And the past real women experiencies (from my mother, lavinia) together with online goddesses show that the mother-image is only in my mind. More so, the King will never allow it to come to being in it's clinging and sacrificing love-style. Just as your mother true soul was a total opposite of the mother-image i've created.

What can I do... The greatly wounded heart is somewhat relieved in moments where i no longer identify with the \"I\". But nonetheless, it is there, greatly burning. Yet today's revelations were truly symbolic. Heart is in a different way, at great peace regarding life. End the day with really simple food, not too many meals, definitely eaten in deficit. But surprinsingly and terrifying, one of the most affected nights followed. Not nearly as bad as yesterday's full bag of chips + chocolate ( which resulted in a 6.5 and 10 sleep).

It's natural. I feel some kind of trigger regarding how skinny they look. In society's views, my legs before were one of my strongest points. Big, muscular, beautiful. The voice of society (As in bro's, gym world, ariana, lavinia, mom) calls the previous form way more BETTER. My friend.. isn't the greatest pain of your life cause exactly by this concept? Of losing the freedom to be as you want, and be what they want? Reflect on a better question regarding your legs, beyond Mirrors. How do they feel? Damn.. strongest form i've ever felt. There have never been so much calmness in my fascial and muscular systems. Often when i walk, i feel the nurturing of my body and joints starting from the ankles. Walking, moving around the house, squatting outside or at granny, is done with great easiness. Calmness. And when there is calm, there can be power. A painful echo of my 'disease' getting worst, as it can be compared to days in which i've 'eated' worst food and slept better. Which would mean sickness, death. Also the body losing weight as it does in sickness. Even though by feeling alone, as described above, i have never felt such easiness in movement and rest. Such easiness in walking and breath. But it's such a foolish comparation, when the level of the studying is taken into comparison. I looked at so little things. How is sleep, even if done same as before? Wayyyyyy more restful, more complete. The more the study deepens, the more everything (and therefore, the problem and symptoms) is seen. How are mental and emotional realms compared to sickness before? Incomparibly better. How are the supplements and remedies? Water and breath now, compared to charcoals, bicarbonate, sticks and pretzels. I call it great progress my friend."}

If you let critical thinking be critical thinking, as just another level of this game of life, it becomes playable. Unit documentations, talking to people, the 'just doing'. But if critical thinking comes with the great echos and fear of the unknown, of the fail, of the not good enough, the level is unplayable and you'll run from it. Last night's dream offers great insight. And the continuous meesages from the unconciousness about this pain - symbolized by skipping school and getting caught stealing at work images. Reflect how much it conditions the food. Let their views be their views. You cannot take seriously just what they say about 'YOU'. Take just as in filter, just as a NPC talk in AC. A farmer telling you need to quit fighting for glory and Valhala is just as Lavinia, AMmy, Mom, Granny telling you should do X.

Watching lavinia, mom, girls, people, pelicanu, everyone - the unconciousness continously speaks and manifets. But it does is so much hiding, as when it's pointed they each react differently. Every word they choose, every face and body movement - if \"I\" is left at the door and guarded like a mouse guards rats, it can be seen. It all springs from deep experiences and beliefs. Truly beautiful. The 'distinction' of reality fades more and more in the sense of the realization that everything is an illusion. Even when reading my diary from first days in Asia, the dhamma of life, the truth of life, the one thing i did not know how to be reminded of at every moment, for it would like make life perfect - was exactly this. The illusion of \"I\". Seeing the world beyond \"I\". But losing the distinction to reality isn't it schizofrenia? Perhaps we reach the same conclusions but they do it chemically. Not by inner search. Just like in the mystical world, a human cannot grasping the most secrets of life and the universe - because he will lose it's mind. But still, we are born with this quest. If i were to express this to the world, they would call me schizofrenic for playing the game of life."}

{"prompt": "Explore the harmony of attraction and repulsion within your body.", "content": "Walking on Sunday.. The only day when the air is clean. Leaf blower experience. Studed for a while Chakra Science from David at Pyramid Yoga center. (Ko Phagan) To be more scientifically blunt, our mind-body connection is very active here at the first chakra level where the gravitational force creates the attraction required to bind the atoms and molecules while the letting go of these molecules is the off switch of gravitation, effected by the on switch of on Anahata\u2019s repulsion. If our first and fourth chakra forces are functional, this process goes on full-time at microsecond speed. These two chakras are the manifestation of these opposing forces: attraction and repulsion. It is most fortunate for us that this entire operation is organized with the greatest sophistication and conveniently placed in our subconscious program bank. There is amazing intelligent engineering displayed in all of our internal functions. With respect, we should feel a sense of gratitude for the creation of us as people with these built-in capabilities. If we fall into a state of fear and doubt about these abilities, they become dysfunctional. Just as the digestive and immune functions do not work at the same time, the stress of fear and worry are not compatible with the relaxed mode needed for healing. It is important to stay connected to the intelligence of the universe with understanding and respect for the knowledge programmed into us. This in itself, creates a sense of peace and calm that make the foundation of auto-immune function. The wisdom contained in this intelligence is known as Buddhi. This is the divine link established in bhakti yoga without which all the other forms of yoga will not succeed to reach the final goal. In Science, this is study and understanding of the divine organization that went into our human design. Without this final plug-in and a sense of appreciation and gratitude, healing is impermanent. When you start to feel ill, lack of energy, pain and discomfort, We should interpret this body language with intelligence and choose an appropriate reaction. To stop eating should be the first step, and certainly not reaching for comfort food. As explained earlier, the digestive system and the immune system do not work well at the same time, so by eliminating digestion for a while the prana and oxygen go to the immune system. The second and third steps would be relax body activity, relax and rest, then thirdly breathe more deeply. This kind of support for the immune system brings it up to peak performance, unless it has been damaged previously, in which case it would need to be the first in line for self-healing."}

Be in calm, content, in love with life, in conflict with life, in back pain, in emotional pain with Reconnect, Viorel(yesterday experience), Ammy, Mommy, pelicanu, work, everything. Whenever you're eating, you eat that emotion. Be it negative or positive. Study this. You eat Vedana. Vedana conditions KS. If the emotion is negative, it is imperative to postpone eating. As long as the negative emotion is present, return to the 3 steps. Stop eating and drink water, Calm the breath. Calm the mind. Cultivate a beautiful emotion through anything you'd love to do at that moment. Speak to Ammy in a certain way, walk, play games, practice the strength dhammas. Then only, eat. What you're feeling completely guides the act of eating, both in food quality, the activity itself and the later digestion of it. As Bhikku writes, vedana rules the world. But is that emotion being fueled or expressed through eating? Depends on the emotion. It seems both. The Dhamma Food Day is amazing, but it serves just as a dhamma house with plants, soft warm floor and space. But it is still You living in this house. This kaya who is completely ruled by vedana.

{"prompt": "How does love shape our shared experiences?", "content": "Buddhist monk Michael: \"Loving support Many years ago, I led a retreat in the south of France at a private meditation centre. When the retreat had ended, I was invited to give a public talk the next evening in the beautiful old walled city of Carcassonne. I was driven there by my organiser and translator and the talk went ahead. After the talk we walked back to the car park to where the car was parked, but now the space was empty! I said, \u201cYour car\u2019s not there.\u201d My student immediately took her glasses out of her bag just to make sure she was seeing properly, but had to agree that the car was missing. Very calmly she said, \u201cO.K. we have to report this to the police and then call my husband to come and collect us.\u201d After we had arrived back at the retreat centre and sat with a cup of tea I told her that I had been very impressed by her calm manner and attitude when she realised that the car had been stolen (It was taken by \u2018joy\u2019 riders and found some days later completely destroyed). \u201cThank you,\u201d she said, \u201cbut it was only because you were standing next to me.\u201d We often think of ourselves in a small way, continually rejecting any idea of self worth and value, but the truth is that everything is affecting everything else, and our presence in any situation can be a support and even a blessing to others. For myself I met this many times when I lived with my teacher. To see him responding in different moments in a wise and loving way was always inspirational. Never showing anger or irritation, but always being strong and clear. When we are angry that has an effect in our life and everything that we come into contact with. When we are loving, that too has an effect in our life and everything that we come into contact with. Of the two, love is better. However, here is the spiritual paradox, if we try to be someone who manifests only certain beautiful qualities, we miss the point of practice. We train ourselves to let go of conditioned ideas of behaviour and simply allow the heart to emerge. The heart (intuitive understanding) \u2018just is,\u2019 and so never tries to show itself. It responds to the moment without looking over its shoulder to see who\u2019s watching. It does not look at the spiritual scoreboard to see how well it\u2019s doing. The heart serves and asks for nothing in return and so is pure. Purity of being is the highest practice. Our own spiritual training is to let go of any limited sense of self identity and be one with this infinitely loving and generous heart. In this way our life becomes a blessing to ourselves and then quite naturally, a blessing to all beings and situations that we meet. May all beings be happy.\" \"Good meditation. It is easy to attach to pleasant feelings in meditation, in fact, we generally use the expression \u2018good meditation\u2019, to indicate that the mind has been calm and peaceful and that the time has passed quickly and without effort. If, however, we have experienced feelings of desire or restlessness or any painful sensations in the body, we will say something else. That was definitely not a \u2018good meditation\u2019. As long as we associate a feeling of \u2018getting high\u2019 on peacefulness with our meditation practice we are still a long way from truth. The purpose of Dhamma practice in general and Vipassana training in particular, is to see the mind as it is in this moment, and not try to make it any particular way. To learn to let go of our desire to change everything so that it is always perfect for us and be at peace with things as they are. With this attitude we can know the truth for ourselves and everything in the mind body complex can be used as a treasure. By using those treasures and taking advantage of their qualities, we can realise enlightenment for ourselves. May all beings be happy.\""}

Brewing tea is just as enjoyable as cutting vegetables, or buying them, or seeing granny. The full dissociation and playing the game. This is what is missing from the second part. This state is greatly conditioned by food, masturbation, stress, emotional pain, physical pain. When each of these state occurs, the contentment of anything i'd do (play) begins fading more and more.

Food is a very powerful reminder of I and spiritual suffering. This state of i'd do anything, no thing in my life pool is less enjoyable than the next. Yes, the idea of working differs slightly because it requires critical thinking and lack of ikigai. But everything else - from stretching to writing, to simply sitting and moving the mouse around, to cooking, cutting, see granny, buy vegetables, reading(requires some level of critical thinking too but is ikigai), ah.. laying on my stomach and writing&thinking 'fantasy thinking' - feels just as enjoyable. I'd do any of these things and all without clinging. This is what i lose in the second part of the day. I'd no longer feel to do with a focused mind any of these, except eating or high doses of life pleasure force from (talking-going out with a hot girl, masturbating if haven't - reproductive) (Getting huge pumps of social media and reconnect spikes. - gold survival in community) (Playing a game i love - like Assassins Creed.) These come in certain intensities and are the only things i'd rather choose at night than eating. It is already a losing hand. I become completely identified with the \"I\". It is no longer a game. The second part of the day is where everything gets serious and problematic. The answer feels simple.. just return to playing the game.

So this got worse and worse as the day progressed. My tooth hurt more and more even tho i kept washing them. At night it was clear. A virus had growned and nourished in my body. A virus i've caught perhaps yesterday - but body beautifully defended it. Although now it makes much more sense the tooth and stomach dukkha that had affected my yesterday's sleep and dhamma day. Still, the body defended it so beautiful that it was hardly noticed. Until i derailed it from fighting the virus. Forcefully aimed it at food dukkha and recovery from masturbation. Focused him on extreme digestion, 2 masturbations. The body was greatly weakned. Now the virus can really thrive. Oh and it did. Awful tooth pain, throat pain, head and running and flooded nose. So bad that it made the mind completely ignore back and stomach discomfort. This shows that they're not as bad as i thought they were. As i laid in bed at night i kept reflecting on Bechamp vs LePasteur debate. The powerful and wise bull in Bhikku's teachings. The thought that just by the slightly constant over-eating in the second part of the day, which was not even that great food dukkha, I could have caused this excrutiating body hurting, Was terrifying. How could i really create all of these? Well, They're both right. I did catch a virus and beautifully fought it until i gave up fighting it. But the real pain was when dukkha had started to arise, more and more, in kaya. Once this happened more and more, the envinronment started turning more nad more into dukkha, into acid, a beautiful home for the virus my body was fighting. Then dukkha thoughts started arising, from fear of disease, to work stress, more work stress about not being able to work and having pressure. Everything. Now what i Eat and Think are oriented 100% towards disease. Fueling it. If anything was there, it now had the perfect conditions to grow and damage the body.

Also talk with Lavinia about her issues burdened me with dukkha. Met Rachita. Smoked the ciggare from yesterday, which was humidified by the night and drained again by sun. This bio-chemistry was very damaging. Also, as known from before, smoking after 17pm brings dukkha. Combined with a Vanilla Bean frappe, it set the place for a truly heavy KS2 and KS2. Got home and all i knew to do was eat yoghurt and milk cereals, in attempt to quinch the arised dukkha. Eate pretty much and KS2 was 6 and 10 affected - waking me up at 3 and following into a heavy morning. It makes perfect sense. Dreamt a heavy dream about school & work."}

When there is contact with form, odors, flavors, thoughts, inner organs vibrations - or whatever at one of sense-doors - That contact is called Phassa. Phassa develops into vedana (feeling) Vedana develops into tanha (craving) Tanha develops into upanada (clinging) Upadana develops into bhava (becoming) Bhava develops into jati, which is \"birth\", and following on from birth there is suffering, sickness, death - which are Dukkha. If there are these sorts of desires and clinging in the mind, it means that vedana has already developed into Tanha. If so, then you must suffer from the spiritual disease of Dukkha, and nobody can help. All the gods together cannot help. The Buddha said that even He cannot help.

That he would not condemn these things in others; and would therefore not be led into those thoughts, feelings and acts of violence towards others which are always characteristic of the people who project the devil in themselves upon the outside. Upon somebody else, upon the scapegoat. This made Jung a very integrated character. He was a man who was thoroughly with himself - having seen and accepted his own nature profoundly. He had a kind of a unity and absence of conflict in his own nature. He was the sort of man who could feel anxious and afraid and guilty... without being ashamed of feeling this way. In other words, he understood that an integrated person is not a person who has simply eliminated the sense of guilt or the sense of anxiety or fear from their life. But rather, is a person who feels all these things, but has no recriminations against themself for feeling them.\u201d ~ Alan Watts"}

Spark: The \"I\" already birthed regarding milk&cookies. Paticassamupada reached upanada(clinging). (phassa-vedana-tahna-upanada) There is no going back, from Bhikku's teachings. It must be stopped at Phassa. Or ultimately, at vedana. I let it slide because i'm feeling so good. I find a comfortable position to eat cereals. What a blessing. Here appears the great trickster, fed by dukkha food and thoughts. I finish 2 and 3 caramel cookie with a bowl of milk and a lady finger. Perhaps until this point it could be a meal to be enjoyed on the floor. I subconciously aknowledge hara hachi bu. I don't want any more food now, but i crave it. I wait a little while for food to settle and make room. But tomorrow i go to office, this also has a subconcious programming to trigger stress and dukkha food. More so, the FPE report is coming back. More so, 1-on-1 is tomorrow, which always embodies the greatest fear of being forced to work 8h. Bla..bla.. bla... The \"I\" already birthded regarding other cookie, then regarding cereals. Not to do it would mean the death of this \"I\". I give in to more. Eat second cookie. Now KS2 is definitely getting upset. As i cultivate dukkha, it is fascinating to notice how more fears to cultivate more dukkha arise. Scenarios in which before i'd true heartedly walk, now seem doubtful as they come up in the mind. The getting fired&poverty, the plane ride regarding back pain and death, even the fucking interaction & insta follow on Andreea feels more pathethic now. Suddenly this tiny voice inside me which says \"What if they're all right and you're the wrong one?\" - My friend, a powerful display on dukkha's effect on core systems. Really you're going to take seriously that she might think it's innapropriate what you did and you should wake up from your fantasy? Put into words seems absurdly foolish. There is also this feeling interpreted as hunger, but it's perhaps just the dellusion of hunger created by the great Trickster. Continue with milk&cereals. More cereals without milk. Definitely a recipe for a heavy, heavy sleep. Wake up at 10 inflamed. Of course. Wake up at 2:30 - more inflamed - water doesn't immediately do the trick. Continue eating corn meal, more milk&cereals - this somewhat calms me, as usual, but is just a short-term fix. Fall asleep until 5:50. Wake up with a very upset KS2. It doesn't even feel like a defeat, for I understand and am in complete peace. I go for a walk singing, despite the KS2 dukkha. I'm sorry love, come here. It's like KS2 is my wife and trickster's aim to is persuade me to beat her up. Sometimes just a slap, sometimes more, but everytime, no matter how hurt she is, she forgives me. Gives me another chance. Takeaway: Mind the spark. The contact. Phassa. In vivo shop the cat can appear and disregard the thought of 2 cookies instantly. Stop at phassa. After the one bowl, the cat can appear and disregard the thought of eating the second bowl or more. But at the second point, the cat's power is affected by food dukkha. Pleasure. --- It feels like it all started with feeling. Contact with The feeling of cookie+milk, On a mental stress (work, office day, andreea married, aloneness) and physical exhaustion. Phassa. Then came the experiencing of the feeling. Vedana. Craving a painless state quickly followed and the only anwer my mind could think of was eating. Craving. Tahna. Clinging quickly followed, as the mind could not think of anything else but eating more and more. Clinging. Upanada. Becoming was, as my friend Bhikku says, unavoidable at this point. Giving in to eating, regardless of consequences. Becoming. Bhava. ---"}

{"prompt": "What does true freedom feel like in your life?", "content": "I get in park and get bubble tea. Here, 2 little school girls were talking very passionately to the baristas about how much they hate school. Everything in my life and dhamma seems to revolve about this. Fredom to live, to love, to experience life. The only suffering with Ammy was again, this freedom being taken. (As per my creation.) The only suffering in DotA - it all went to shit when i started to have a schedule that i couldn't keep. When freedom was taken away. Numquam cedere libertatum. Reflecting more and more i realize this also related to the back pain. I somehow escaped and cheated through school and here i was, being proud of my IT 8 hours job and gym. Deep back in the system. But pain quickly arose. Great back pain. And because of that pain, found my ways of cheating again the system. Found brotherhood. And when the cheats were at danger and had to again bend to the system, unconsciousness started burning. The dream of quitting my job and waking up to a board with 'FREEDOM' written on it. Anything else but this. Entrapment of life. My hell. And finally, with the dhamma aid, i managed to completely break free from the corporate life. But not completely. As this hell continues to exist in me. When working and having pressure - again having to bend down, when people want to control me, to teach me when i not want to be teached. When having to do something i don't want to do, having to be somewhere i don't want to be. This is my greatest suffering in life. From childhood to now. Perhaps the pure cause of your back pains. Perhaps the cause of your stomach pains. Greatest pain in relationships with women. Because until recently, women experience meant having to give up and be with a woman i won't want to be. Everybody pushing me to this. Until Ammy. Everything. My greatest suffering. The one thing that births \"I\" most powefully. This is what is to be guarded. Have trust that whatever happens, you will find a way. Will find cheats. As long as the sun rises up in the morning, i will cheat. I will not bend down. Play. Let critical thinking be critical thinking only. Let some taps on the screen be done in your terms. In freedom. You will always find a way. The only limit is imagination. Orszi ask you for something which might eventually reflect your failings? And not doing of home-work? What u do? What does your body, breath and FOOD relationship do? Oh and Octavian might catch you and eventually confront your workstyle? And oh, then i'd have to actually work 5-6-7 hours, be controlled and watched. \"Having my homework checked and graded.\" What is there that is so scary? The ultimate layer of your fears. Lose job, not have money and eventually need to bend down and work 8 hours. This perhaps is my greatest fear. It would mean Enclosing of the spirit. Of the FREEDOM. Then, oh.. everything will go to fuck. So seriously you take it my friend. Whaever he does, you adapt. You speak people language, but act in dhamma langauge. If not taken seriously, it can be really fun to partake this dance. Its just a childish fear. But it sits at the core of your being. Everything you know seem to arise from this battle. Talk to yourself about this fears just as you talk to Pelicanu. The \"I WILL NOT BEND DOWN SPEECH.\" Considering fucking hurting him in the real world if he messes with your freedom. I am a warrior, not a child anymore. Nobody will take my freedom. I will fucking KILL, as my ancestors did, AND FUCKING DIE FOR MY FREEDOM. The magician's imagination will fucking explode and find ways in impossible situations. The warrior will never give up and is ready to go to the edge of the fucking world for this. Trust yourself. Then the greatest fear will be addressed. The dark side will never win. In this, the letting go of \"I\" can happen once again. The game can be played. Some big problems arise? You just act like you bend down for a while, like an assassin blending, and resort to any kind of solution without limits. More, the ultimate layer of your fears are actually.. your parent's greatest fears? Worst case, i wake up with no money and no job, what is so scary? It is not just another level? Eating cheap vegetables and oats and saving money? Oh but the pleasures of life, weed, quality phone&headphones, tooth extreme pains, simple food, good PC? If getting to that point, i am absolutely sure my parents will take care of this. Life would still be very much enjoyable. (same Cosu) And it will be as all things, impermanent. Just another level of this game. Another flavor. But this is so highly unlikely. You've gathered so many skills that by just living your life by heart, will win you some money. So you see why your hell, your greatest spiritual suffering - is but an illusion. An echo from the past. A memory. Not work, not family, not friend, nobody will ever rob you of your FREEDOM."}

Amadahy really is one goddess who practiced spiritual experiences in her relations. Very fascinating to experience. But i will always remain a watcher, a viewer of these spiritual experiences. I feel at peace with that. Damn how much i've forced my body to retain from food and more so, to enclose it in fixed patterns of the mind. Your body will always reflect what you truly feel inside. The struggles, the emotions, the life inside. Trying to forcefully create a beatuiful exterior (greek warrior body) - will come with spirit sacrifice. \"You cannot go against your instinct without great spirit sacrifice.\" Reflect how beautifully your body 'bulked' up in the first part of Thailand's journey and 'cut' down in second part. How it touched it's peak phisique with magical easter 'cut' - which was an absolute spiritual release and experience. Bulked up the more you were suffering with Ammy and your demons. Efortless. In Flow. Cut down again when re-united with Ammy. Bulked up again when started to feel suffocated and lost/enclosed in Ammy dynamic. Cut down again when she left and you've tasted absolute freedom again. Wow.. It truly seems absolutely impossible to force it from the outside-in. How bad i felt last days. More and more i forced, the more and more i felt bad. More and more de-focused, more and more drained. Cannot work, cannot train, cannot stretch, nothing feels good - sleep more and more awful. The modern-man scientist (mother in your dream) blamed it all on smoking. How foolish, mother. How can you explain then the entries just a few days ago which described an amazing, full of peace and rest sleep ? For sure it plays a role, but not nearly as absolute. The body will continuously reflect the inside. And the inside cannot be changed in force. But in love and acceptance. Just as i stood relaxed on my pc, watching my favorite dota team play, with post cum on my belly and food dripping on my chest. This is me. Well, a part of me at least. <3 Is it not then, futile to force changes ? More so, always creating a disturbance in the soul-mind-body continuum. How do people do it then? Well perhaps the same way they bow down to a 8-5 office job and spend their little free time talking about empty non-sense. But i return to what i was reflecting at it's worst peak. 1. Forcing habits to stop vs. 2. Creating new ones. 1. Strict calories, protein, training schedule, no food after x, weigh everything, control everything -> further delussioned into absolutely denying smoking. - Purpose of the mind (look like that, prove i can) 2. The 10.000 steps concept. A gentle reminder of how beautiful it is to walk. It's not a strict number, but an body-mind-soul reminder of how much dhamma it cultivates. - Purpose of evolution, of 'watering' the garden which is the body, of Big difference. Still both, as does any change in body's composition, require CHANGE. LIFESTYLE CHANGES. Something will be different. But the first one cuts out parts of who are YOU today, while the second one invites you to experience more places, more feelings, more more more.. life. !Cutting things down from lifestyle vs. Adding things i love to it. All of this begs the question.. Does the body lose and gain weight and strength, or does it adapt ?"}

{"prompt": "Imagine a world where kindness shapes our reality.", "content": "Training disciples. A question often asked by aspiring disciples is; how can I improve my Dhamma practice? Here I will share some of the things that were useful to me during my training. Universal Love. Cultivating an open-hearted accepting relationship with all beings is the first step of relinquishing the fear that dominates our life. Beings are the way they are, that is their choice but you are the way you are, and that is your choice. Judging, criticizing and commenting on the behavior of others does not take you to peace and only demonstrates your need for everyone to conform to your ideas of how they should be. Responding to each moment with wisdom and love rather than from fear and anxiety, will keep our place in the centre of any storm. Here we are more likely to see the reality of the situation instead of creating another mind-based fantasy. As a footnote to this: Kamma and Vipaka are universal realities and if beings truly understood the consequence of their empowerment of greed and hatred in the world, they would change every aspect of their life. The behavior of others therefore, does not need your comments. Kamma and Vipaka operate in an impersonal way therefore beings will always meet the consequence of the mind states they empower. Elegance. Dhamma has the quality of being beautiful therefore we, as representatives of this beauty must behave accordingly. Not to slouch when we meditate, relax or eat but to sit with a straight back and pay attention to our posture and our comportment. To chew with our mouth closed and to handle all food whether preparing, cooking or serving, as the gift it truly is. To walk gracefully whether on retreat or not. To greet others with a simple hello or smile. To be friendly. Speech. To be honest, but always kind. Don't humiliate another simply to score a point in an argument or disagreement. State your case quietly and clearly and let it go. It is rare that others immediately see or understand our point of view, and by insisting that we are right and they are wrong, we can only cement our opposing positions. Behavior. Don't involve yourself in multitasking. It is a myth that we can do many things simultaneously, so learn to give your full attention to the one activity you are engaged in and then flow to the next without pause. This moment to moment focus and awareness will bring peace to your life and stress will not be an issue for you. Give up ambition. Simply do what you're supposed to do and let go of any idea of an ultimate goal. Life will take care of itself and the more you stay open to its infinite possibilities, rather than focusing on one solitary outcome, the more it will respond unhindered by the mind and its endless desires and fears. Work. As much as you are able, find employment that serves others and brings a degree of satisfaction to you. If you are not able to do this, then use your work as your Dhamma vehicle, to watch your frustration and irritation with the environment and your colleagues and to let these negative influences fall away. To find ourselves in situations that are uncomfortable for us is a beneficial way to train. Relax. In the end, for most of us, it's only work, and like all things, it only has the value we give it. Don't compromise or look for short cuts. Our training is to let go of ego demands and harmonize with the reality of life, not create a special feeling around what we do, therefore we must stay on the path surrendering into the simplicity of the practice and pass through any mind based obstacles such as boredom and desire. Integrity and consistency of practice are the most important things. Service. To be available when we see the need is how we serve the world. To offer service to another is the mark of an open heart, from the classic example of helping an old lady across the road to offering our time and possible expertise in different situations, but never seeking reward or acknowledgement. We do not live in isolation and so the moment we become aware of the many daily blessings in our life, we can offer our help to any being, human or not, who need assistance in that moment. Generosity. When fear and desire are not present, we will be spontaneously generous, sharing the best part of ourselves with the world. We don't need to search for particular charities to support but only to be open to the needs of the world at large or our own particular environment and offer our help, whatever that can be. Kindness. Simply be kind, you have nothing to lose. These are some of the qualities to bring forward in your life to enhance the dissolution to the attachment to a 'self' identity, the basis for all our difficulties. Only 'self' makes demands on the world and so only 'self' can suffer. The less \u2018you\u2019 there is the happier and more peaceful life will be. May all beings be happy."}

Also get chips and corn cereals. I convince myself that i will not over-eat. (second spark) I get home - smoke with yoPro yoghurt - go to bed and want to masturbate - start eating bread. Hara hachi bu is clouded by the white bread - i feel it around after 2 and a half pieces. I eat 4. I'm so full that it begins to cultivate dukkha. What's the neural path begin read?

{"prompt": "What would you give up for true freedom?", "content": "Too easy Dhamma When the Buddha renounced his princely life, he gave up everything to be free. To ask him later was it worth leaving everything behind, we know that he would say yes, and that nothing can equal enlightenment and freedom from suffering. For myself, when I was training with my teacher for all those years, I often had to sell things, including my Beatles cassettes, to afford the train and boat fare to travel to the monastery and then leave a donation after my time with him. It is certainly true that I didn\u2019t want to give up my Beatles collection, but was it worth it ? Yes, undoubtedly, yes. One martial arts teacher I knew in Israel was visited by a young man who told him that he would like to be a student and train with him, but he had no money. \u2018That\u2019s alright,\u2019 said the teacher, \u2018you can paint my house !\u2019 The master wants to see effort from the disciple. They want to see how much value you place upon your training and how much determination you will make to be free. They want to see you transcend any hardship by placing your Dhamma training above everything else. Only in this way will we go past the places in our life where we usually stop! However, these days it seems that many people don\u2019t really want to end their suffering at all, they only want to negociate it and so in the end, they are not prepared to prioritise Dhamma training if it means that they may miss out on something else. For the Master the most important thing is their own integrity, for the disciple it is effort and clarity of intention. When we are disciples we need to ask ourselves, \u2018do I really want to be free, is that why I\u2019m sitting in meditation and going to monasterys occasionally, or do I want something else ?"}

{"prompt": "What does it mean to truly be one with everything?", "content": "\"Walking the Path. Meditation is the most important gift we can give ourselves in this life. To sit without waiting for something, to be still and simply accept that which is presented to us with love and humility, is the essence of this beautiful practice. In the silence of this spacious and peaceful mind we will see, but more importantly experience directly, the reality of this being that we call self. Here there is no-where to hide from the truth, and when the heart is open and willing to know, we will joyfully accept the reality presented to us without compromising. This is the beauty of the meditation practice now known as Vipassana \u2013 a practice that transcends technique, tradition and dogma, and allows us to meet the truth. However, without the fearless meditative nature we can easily cultivate just another way to misunderstand what we experience. To continue to compound our delusion by rejecting the truth of each moment and ignoring the reality of impermanence and emptiness: \u2018whatever arises passes away and is not what we are\u2019. When we look closely, with our eyes and heart unclouded by views, opinions and other delusive ideas, we will know and understand that in absolutely real terms, at the place of pure dhamma, there is no individual or separate self that exists. There is no meditator, only the meditation, there is no feeler, only the feeling, there is no person, only the process of life. It will be as though we watch clouds passing through an empty sky. Every thought, mood, feeling and emotion is just another cloud to watch. They have shapes and apparent realities, but if we try to hold them as something real and enduring we will see that each of them has the same quality as all phenomenon, to be insubstantial. To be empty. And so it is with the fantasy of self, of \u2018I\u2019, \u2018me\u2019 and \u2018mine\u2019. When we are able to meet the truth without fear and delusion, we will see that these are only words, only convenient ways to speak, but have no place in the realm of the absolute truth. In the realm of pure dhamma. They are only labels on that which cannot be labelled. No matter how powerful or real it may seem, \u2018I\u2019 is just another thought that arises and passes away in this moment. \u2018Me\u2019 and \u2018mine\u2019 can only be the same. However, arising simultaneously with these thoughts are all the divisions that exist in life. \u2018You\u2019, \u2018yours\u2019, \u2018theirs\u2019, \u2018ours\u2019, etc. None of them have a real or substantial nature, but all of them are thought worthy of persecuting for, fighting for and dying for. The full and complete comprehension of the truth of the emptiness of a separate and \u2018real self\u2019, (Anatta) brings the perfect liberation from suffering and unhappiness in life, for all suffering begins with the delusion of \u2018self\u2019. Arising with this liberation is the experience of oneness with all beings and the supreme joy of \u2018beingness\u2019. No longer being someone or something, but simply \u2018being one\u2019 with all things. When there is no attachment to a self identity, who is it that gets old, gets sick and dies? When there is no attachment to a self identity, who is it that experiences pain and heat and cold? When there is no attachment to a self identity, who is it that will hurt, fight and kill others? To be free from the delusion of self is to be free from the difficulties of life. Our life will stay the same but the problems fall away. After all, if there really is no fixed or abiding self, who is it that suffers? Everything is without a separate self. The one who understands this through insight and wisdom, is freed from suffering. (Dhammapada: verse 279)\""}

Even if it\u2019s extremely arousing, it's different. I don't want her to dominate me at all, and neither does she. It manifests throughout all my body. Micro-muscles filled with emotion and twitching at the thought of loving her. Of how much she loves me. How simple and truly. Wants to do everything with me. It begs the question. Is this how love can kill you ? Is this how John Keats died? The poet who, facing the imposibility of her love, he retired, wrote \"When I have fears that I may cease to be\" - and died alone of inexplicable disease. I fear this. Of course I over-eate last night. And just as I've recognized it being extremely similar as in body-sensations to the \"shadow's extasy\", who I know for sure it's ultimate pleasure and purpose is to end LIFE ? Although in sensations of the souls it feels very different. This is observed best when transposing the fantasy to reality. How it would feel during and after the experience. A \"Shadow's fantasy\" leaves an empty soul and disconnected from dhamma. But scenarios in which I'm Loving Ammy in different ways fills my heart. It creates life. What if the visa is not approved? Then this will continue for MUCH more longer. If I only knew she will be here on the 28th June, I could breath again. What if she stays for 3 months and then has to leave again? And being more in love then, the \"shadow's extasy\" will be more stronger as well? Part with her again.. Should I no longer give way to it? - I often ponder Block it, talk to her less, imagine less? Fear that if I'd give way fully to it, it would kill me. Or at least make me MISS the present. So in the attempt to not MISS the present, I tend to want to stop giving way to this uncontrolabble thoughts.. and in the process, I might be ironically missing the present. Just as I write this, an Allan wats \"song\" comes out of the coffee shop speakers. He says only one phrase and then it's just music. \"Don't take life too seriously\" Hahaha :))). Well, you've done ALL it took in the people world to get her here. All visa documents and shit pending. Rationally, It's out of your control. Sit back, relax, and enjoy.

But fate had it that as I overeat bread and lactose products (which clearly and instantly trigger body rashes), dukkha was cultivated and I went down to get them. So I eventually eate them.

My disease started soon after his. And it was not long before mine would somewhat reflect parts of his. Constant burping after meals, bloated. Except I eate too much, he eate too little. After a while, he started losing weight and a powerful energy surrounded him embodying death. Especially when he was eating. The way he could not eat.. such small and fearful bites like a sick, dying animal. Death was crawling slowly. Talking with Itu I realized the fine irony of it. Some people cannot eat due to great sickness, and I eat too much and cause sickness. My beloved grandfather is slowly dying because he cannot eat. I am slowly dying because I cannot stop eating. Well, my friend. Quite a painting. It becomes impossible to ignore that they could be related Could it be.. You are eating to save Bubu? Could it be that, on an unconciousness level, you started to eat to save him? Despite on the surface being somewhat \"unaffected\" of his sickness and death, because - it was not happening to me, so it was far from what I felt when I had the back trauma. The fascinating thing is that I contemplated somewhat about this back then. It was so heart-breaking when I would over-eat and feel awful \u2013 then go downstairs to their apartment only to see him in his awfulness. I'd feel so weak and more so, I am neglecting the gift of life itself. Life is so precious. I am, in a way, dishonoring life by deprivating it to sustain that beautiful body-mind-soul alchemy which feels the most dhamma. The absolute truth. But instantly dismissed it. \"Nah, it could not be. It has to be food, sicknesses, viruses, bla bla bla bla\" So when I had a gastroscopy and the doctor used my results to show the med students what a really healthy stomach looks like, I was left studying finer stuff. \"Nah, it must be food allergies, fine incompatibilities, amount of gastric acid production because of bla bal bla bla\" It definitely is a part of it. But take last night. Dhamma day. Amazing feeling in body, strong, powerful, good and not in excess food, amazing connection to Bi, Ammy is well and at peace. Yet, unexplicabilly, I eat pufu with caju yoghurts right before sleep which really fucked me up. Just like Bubu with his attempts to eat healthy, whole foods and most importantly, not drink alchohol. I was fully convinced that food played a huge, huge impact. Especially, the alcohol. It was the most the one thing he had falled into the \"Excess\". Got drunk almost every 2-3 days for over 40 years. Even often when he was retired. But could never keep up the restrictions. Always gave up after a few days. When feeling better. When wanting to \"taste\" his recipe of a beautiful life again. Just like ME. What if, beyond all the precious knowledge you gather by studying foods and how they bind and change the body's alchemy, there lies this deep, so obvious yet bluntly ignored, trauma ? Your best friend. Bubulet. Man, he was in many ways the father you wanted. Always had time for you, you were the most important thing in the world to him. Gave you money, took you with him. Teached you his ways about women and money. About life. As flawful as it was, those was his ways. And he full-heartedly passed them on. Your best friend. He left you everything he had in both knowledge and \"fortune\". In his dying bed he held your hand and dreamed about my wedding that. For that is what enlightment was in his ways of life. I remember the exact feelings of the moment he called me and told me cancer had gotten him, he's been diagnosted with a late stage one. I thought he was joking at first based on his tonality. Soon after, he clinged to any hope until the last moment and enjoyed life. What if, my friend, the inexplicable force that drives your \"sickness\", is the attempt to save your best friend Bubu ? What if, the mountains are once again mountains? The same mountains I saw in the beginnings and dismissed because it felt soo science fiction. Even though on conciousness level you are fully at peace with his death and you feel his energy flowing through your veins, there was the unconciousness at play ?"}

Then felt bloated and just kept going and going. Of course, it is worth considering that the body will always tend to consume the amount of energy it burned during the day. If this doesn't happen during the day.. it will tend to happen at night. So as that 8-9 pm hits, it\u2019s not only dukkha that is causing you to emotionally eat and affect your sleep.

{"prompt": "What beauty do you see that stirs your soul?", "content": "---Be Honest to yourself, Bring Consciousness to Attachment--- \u201cAt one time I was teaching at a local group and I arrived early. I parked my car next to the most beautiful car I have ever seen. Now, I have no interest what-so-ever in cars, but this was special. The aesthetics were incredible. It was a bottle green Jaguar, low, sleek and smooth. The interior was clean with deep plush seats and a polished wooden dashboard. It was like looking at a beautiful sunrise. I had no desire to own it, but I could certainly appreciate it\u2019s inherent beauty. I went in to the Dhamma hall to meet the only person there, a woman whom I had met two or three times previously. \u2019Is that your car outside?\u2019 I asked. \u2019Yes,\u2019 she replied, but I\u2019m not attached!\u2019 There is a way to speak that people often use to convey the sentiment that they know Dhamma. There is a jargon and a style that covers their true non - understanding, and that they can talk about attachment, kamma, suffering and the rest, as though they have already transcended. As though they know. The truth is however, that only people who don\u2019t know speak in this way, those who carry Dhamma in their hearts speak naturally and honestly about life, never making a show. Those who speak do not know. \u8a00\u8005\u4e0d\u77e5 Those who know do not speak. \u77e5\u8005\u4e0d\u8a00 (Tao te Ching verse 128) It is true that attachment is the cause of our suffering because in the end, whatever we are attached to will hurt us. It is inevitable and the proof of this, as with everything that is Dhammic, is found in our ordinary daily life. Reflect, why do you suffer? The answer is always simple, it is because in this moment you are attached to an idea of how things should be. The reality does not meet your idea and so suffering arrives. Subtle or gross it is always like this. However, without fully understanding the words of the teacher we think that we are being told that we shouldn\u2019t have any attachments, but this is not the truth. The Master tells us that whatever we are attached to will hurt us \u2013 that\u2019s all! How we move with this is in our life is for us to discover for ourselves. Attachment is subtle and when we are attached to even one thing, the whole universe of attachment is in front of us. One student of mine told me once that she had no attachments at all, except for her own bed at night. It doesn\u2019t seem to be very much, but the attachment to this one simple thing opens the door for everything else. From one attachment the whole universe of attachments arises. So our way is always to be honest and recognise that attachment is just attachment, no need to pretend it\u2019s not there. It\u2019s not wrong to be attached, it just brings a consequence, that\u2019s all. Playing the Dhamma game in front of others has no value at all, especially in front of the teacher, and liberation will come when we realise that our suffering and unhappiness has a cause, and that we can do something about it. So, the next time you are unhappy, find a quiet place alone and ask yourself, \u2018In this moment, what is it that I am attached to?\u2019 The answer will always be the same, \u2018I am attached to the idea that this moment should be different from the way it is!\u2019 Once we accept the reality of this moment and surrender into it, there is no space for suffering to arise. Enjoy what can be enjoyed, and let go. Endure what has to be endured, and let go. This is true liberation. May all beings be happy."}

{"prompt": "What comfort food do you crave when feeling tired?", "content": "Observing a food diary day for better understanding: Breakfast around 10-11 some avocado + toast + coconut. Really good, I felt energetic and second kaya sankhara also loved it. But for lunch, my t-spine pain was triggered from before workout and my body very tired. It truly longed for sleep. But I have a Better idea. Eat :> I think and become attached to eating comfy food while watching tv series. So I find the least-filled dukkha combination to do so. 50-100g grisine + 400g yoghurt will suffice. I start eating and it tasted amazing, I don't want this moment to end soon. Connection to breath is no longer concious. After 50 grisine and 400g yoghurt I feel more than satiated. But far from full. \"It\u2019s fine, it\u2019s easy food, will not inflame the ks2\" I can feel dukkha already rising and cultivating more dukkha. But the trickster, the dark side of the magician archtype in me, persuades into thinking it\u2019s fine, it will not hurt me. So I continue.. until 100g grisine and 800g yoghurt is consumed. Wow.. now 2 things are clear. I somewhat over-eate. I should stop now. Anymore food is definitely gonna cultivate dukkha. But as I stand there in the same envinronmental alchemy (tv series, closed room air, body position), I cannot stop. I'm gonna rest a little and immediately go for more food. I rest for 20 min, the ks2 calms down and begins to switch from \"eating\" to \"digesting\". Body is feeling pretty good, the cultivated dukkha is minimally impacting my current state. Still, this pulls me far from dhamma-state. There is no awareness to kaya-sankhara. Just as I feel ks2 is slowly calming, I jump to get more food and cotinue my fantasy. But it is not in the same frequency any longer. Because more dukkha is present with each bite and I have to put a lot of energy to ignore this and only focus on the pleasure of eating. Soon, more dukkha fills my mind, as each bite is now also hurting my fitness progress. And clearly hurting my digestive system health. I finish some snacks and I'm really full now. \"What now?\" Dukkha is all around. I have no energy, no mood for seeing any people, no mood to work or watch anything valuable. My whole body's energy is now directed at dealing with this inflamation and over-fed digestive system. \"The only way out is to keep eating.\" - says the trickster. Yes he's right, in a twisted way. But at this point is clear that any bite will now GREATLY bring dukkha. Mind keeps multi-tasking, finding content in nothing. I keep switching between tv series, YouTube, TikTok, messages. Nothing is peaceful. All is done to ignore the ks2 inflamation and ironically, ks2 dukkha follows everywhere. I know already that at any point this happens, one clear way to cultivate dhamma, is go for a walk. Move. Experience life outside the eating. \"Ok, Do this for a little while and then get something good, more to eat on the way home\" - the trickster whispers. Ok trickster, I'll play your play, because I know this will cultivate dhamma and once I am done, I will have more control and not fall into it again. So I take my bike around the forest. Beautiful experience. I love each breath. My body is indeed very tired from waking up at 4. I want to be home and rest. KS2 beautifully calms and need for rest & sleep arises. I can feel it damaged, but dhamma arises. I don't want to be extreme and not eat anything at all, so I'm gonna have a little meal. Of course, some dukkha was still there. This fueled the trickster to play his part and persuade into getting something I'd could eat & watch tv series. I see him and I reach somewhat of a compromise. Little milk + protein bar. It\u2019s the best I could come to, which would somehow keep at bay the dukkha. So I get home and stop by granny's. \"Take 3 biscuits also, the protein bar is really just 70g..\" - trickster whispers Ok.. I guess 3 biscuits are fine, as my Ks2 is really at calm now and I can truly feel that eating just this protein bar will end my day with less energy eaten than consumed, which my body was telling me not to. I take 4 biscuits. On the way out, he whispers again: \"See that little bag of tortizi, which is more than half empty? Take it, you'll see how you feel. Maybe you'd enjoy it\" I instantly do it and get home. Of course, I knew tortizzi is one the of snacks which inflames me most in medium-high quantities. But only a little bit. Exactly the same process unfolds as at lunch, connection to breath is completely lost and I hang on to the pleasure eating creates until I finish everything, and even more. I'm so fucking full. And tired. I have no energy to go for a walk now, or even stand in a position that aids the ks2 in digestive. I go to sleep. I breath heavily and nausea."}

Until this was done, I was left with its pressure and need for manifestation. For in my creation, it was like she trying to friendzone me. But the universe had other plans. She didn\u2019t respond for 2 hours. Instantly eated way way way over the limit. When I was left full and with kaya-sankhara2 inflamed and overwhelmed, she responded with a quick message which would shatter my creation. She felt Exactly the opposite. But I already committed the crime. Dukkha had risen. And dukkha invited more dukkha. So I went and bought 300g chocolate, milk. Came home. Masturbated. Eate more and more. Even tho the emotion had disappeared when I learned the truth. Because kaya-sankhara2 was already filled with dukkha. And placing in home environment, it\u2019s the programmed way to cope. Eat more.

Her love is not real and it\u2019s just a fucking masterpiece of a scam who runs on the strongest emotion of all. Passion. 3. Her love is real but either unconsciously or consciously she also wants to scam me. (No matter how pure the motive is, like the safety of her kids.) I told her this. Her reaction was somewhat neutral. Then I called her and told her. She avoided 2-3 times then answered that her love is real. Then, all of a sudden, she got cold. (Like when she felt I\u2019ve read her intentions.) This was in my creation. Logically pointing to the art of falling in love scam. But the feelings are so so real. So in my creation, in how I interpret her words, seen, etc -points to number 3. Talking to her on the phone I realize in her creation she just got \u201craped\u201d by a man she hates and feels disgusted with herself. So disgusted to even open the chat with me and gimme love.

Then college came and everything went to shit \u2013 because that was not my way of learning. But now, I have the insight, knowledge and power to choose my learning path. Carve it. \"Work\" enlightment. Work from anywhere in the worlds, high salary, work a few hours a day. This is greatness. Yardi is surrendering to something good enough, but not truly desired. Yardi = Lavinia in terms of women. I delusioned myself into thinking this is greatness because the road ahead implied \"school\" vibes and \"not good enough\" echos.

And now that I have achieved greatness in Love, work follows. It's clear. And so step 1 is complete. Bring the dukkha completely to light. See it. Accept it as part of yourself. Only then it can be truly changed. For this, the plan is: See outside your box. Gather wisdom. Speak with people who are already there and learn their ways.

{"prompt": "Explore the sacred connection between food and well-being.", "content": "Observing and feeling a lot of dukkha as the dust settles and old habits echo. Most important and clear factor is the food. There is a very subtle line which exactly feeds the body, rest is dukkha. And as I said before, dukkha culivates more dukkha.. Eating is a truly sacred energy exchange. It is by far, the heaviest from the 3 ways the phisycal body uses to consume energy and bind with the \"outside\" - Breathing - Drinking - Eating. Whenever citta begins to control the eating process to escape any present spiritual, emotional or phisycal dukkha, it suppresses the connection to Dhamma. To the spirit. To the soul. So eating, again, should be recognized and respected as sacred in every moment. Every moment directed towards the well-being of the kaya. This does not limit the magician, which can find amazing tasty ways which also fully nurtures the body. Finding dhamma in both time, quantity and quality of food should prevail before the magician makes any move. If dukkha arises, the magician will try to find tasty, healthier-ish ways to deal with citta wanting to overeat and overeat to hide the guilt of overeating. Nialau: [*TBT \"sufletu care ar trebui sa fie stapan nu poate sa mai supuna trupul care e alimentat peste masura.\"] \u201cThe soul that should be the master can no longer subdue the body that is fed excessively.\u201d After 3-4 hours of not eating, dhamma is cultivated. More and more. So, as evening settles, what an actual privilege is to allow dhamma to rise once the digestive system calms down and begins to rest. As hours go by, the kaya can become the new object of study. Because when the digestive system is working, kaya along with vedana become clouded. As the fog rises, a new chance arises to deeply study kaya and vedana. Long breath can be used to achieve new depths in the observing. Once this happens, the citta becomes single-focused. And naturally, there is piti. (contentment) In this state, the needs of kaya become clear. Water, cleaning teeth, body positions, and so on. Again, it is a truly beautiful thing to experience every day. This is what I called \"clarity\" when I was fasting years ago. And in it, everything taste different. Writing, water, pissing, everything. The flavor of each of these things changes when the body is nourished and no longer digesting. What the citta had labeled \"craving for food\" - can be instantly altered to how amazing it is to explore this state. How much it cultivates dhamma."}

Or hide behind a cloud only to come out again in the aliveness of the wind. Both of their hearts would feel a great void. For there was first the sun, and life followed millions of years later. It is one of the primordial sunkhara(condition) for life and for any human. It conditions life. It would not exist without it. It is an undeniable part of any human to seek on a spiritual level, some connection the Sun. For ancient people, it embodied the symbols of God. Of transcending human life and suffering.

{"prompt": "What does true love feel like to you?", "content": "Ammy story. \u2764\ufe0f Living in Surat Thani seemed very close to the natural truth of life. The language of the soul. Movement, daily foods and habits, interactions with people and nature, the sun and wind, the air and the contentment which embraces my body when I breath. Peace. Still, there is something missing. True love, which was one of the main things I came here to explore and learn about, had been evading me. Tasting pieces of it in different girls, but merely pieces arisen from passion, not love. And gracefully, we enter what feels like the last part of my journey in Thailand. Love. Liberation of the heart. The immense piece I felt missing from my soul since I was but a little kid. At every point of my life, when all thoughts would fade away, I experienced this void. The soft voice running in the background of my life at all time, telling me something big is missing. A flavor of life I need to experience and never had. One of the most purest experiences. Enlightenment through love. Just as in the physical world, her body feels like a piece of puzzle perfectly matching the piece my body is, just so on a spiritual level I found in her the piece I had always searched. It tastes intense and amazing. \u2764\ufe0f Exactly how I intuitively felt true love would feel like when I was but a kid. Still, my spirit feels at peace. There is contentment in the unavoidable impermanence of this. What powerful flavors of contentment (piti in buddhist term) I feel with Ammy. It makes my heart and body shake in many ways. Her son and daughter opened up to me the second time we met. Smiled and were comfortable around me. Even more so, safe. Like I had their blessing for my love towards their mother. Especially Tommy. We had a good time and I really enjoyed it. I was not playing with him as most adults do, but playing with him as if was too, a kid. I feel like one. He looked as me with eyes filled with admiration and acceptance. Just as I wished my father was to me when I was a child. In no rush to prioritize other things over me, but completely be there with me. And the way she loves him.. it\u2019s just as I wished my mother loved me. It\u2019s just as I want the mother of my children to love them. Thats why I love to call her \u201cmommy\u201d. There was a moment where I cared for her injured feet together with Tommy. Then we both leaned on her affectionate lap. Beautiful. \"We love you mommy.\" - was the energy our bodies were expressing. But we love you in different ways, not overlapping and it feels like you have infinite love for both of us. When I look at Ammy my heart is filled with emotion. She is absolutely stunning from every angle and in every lighting. A flavor of the piti comes from the attachment that I have, for the first time in my life, attaining Dhamma. The whole feeling that nothing is missing. Absolute truth of life. And the thought of going back to Romania \u2013 therefore not experiencing this same feeling anymore. Wow. What a contrast. In the past few days, I contemplated so much about what missing someone is. I understood it theoretically. But I never really missed anyone. Never left in suffering after any break up. \u201cAm I so heartless?\u201d - I was left wondering each time I broke up with a girl. Why am I feeling absolutely nothing in my body regarding any woman\u2019s absence ? Because none of them truly spoke my \u201clove language\u201d. So their affection and energy never really reached me.

This feeling appears to be manifesting in her body. I could feel this pattern and although it was interesting and intense to go along the play, something doesn\u2019t feel right in this love language. As in I, the father, would never hurt her. And thats why there is a clear feeling that this is a one time-few times only. But now reflecting, it becomes clear how much more enjoyable it makes her father\u2019s touch and love if she knows the contrast of it. Continuesly, in a play which her kaya and vedana no longer know its a play. It leaves me wondering if a woman without this stained pattern of love, would she enjoy sex as much ? It\u2019s a clear no. She\u2019d possibly enjoy more the spiritual-life giving part of sex, but the act would never have these kind of spikes. Or maybe you could do it just the same ?"}

I came out with the revelation that for the pleasure to be real, the suffering must be real. Me being absolutely crazy attracted by her energy and feminity and she - taking great pleasure in my suffering. Love... and it being denied in the most glorious ways. The pattern for love I've written in my childhood. The shadow.\""}

{"prompt": "What does freedom feel like in a chaotic world?", "content": "--- Play: Alphaville - Forever Young --- Day with Jane. While training, I see a beautiful girl walking in park blowing baloons. Such a powerful image. So childish, pure and feminine. I go to her. She is a bit held back at first, but then slowly stars investing and becoming comfortable with me. She has a little bag with the marijuana sign hanging onto her purse. I ask her to go get bubble tea with me. She says Yes. There is something different about her. Her mind seems to have taken a different path than most people. Logic and reason do not exist in her realms. She is controlled and living purely through her emotions and connection to the outside world. She becomes fascinated and her attention is immediatly drawn away by random outside stimulis like a flower, a child, an animal. It's quite beautiful to watch actually. A free spirit, who does not care about what people think or what would be the rational thing to do. But just do it. Let whatever feelings come up manifest without judgement or resistance. Then I started to know her life's story. I was so curious how did she get so free, how could she find such enjoyment in everything and in everyday. Well, it seems that just as I did. Through pain. Although she had it worse. Phisycal and emotional mountains of pain, revolving around her country, family and running away. With her country at war, she fought for the peace and love of her people, only to be thrown into jail for a couple of months and then prociding to hide away in the jungle. Here, she learned how to fire a gun and fight. But her heart disagreed. No more fighting. No more partaking in Death. So she ran away to Thailand. Alone. Many tattoos all over her body, each of them telling a different story. They are mostly about travelling, love, freedom and her life's ideology. ''I'm still in love with my ex'' - she tells me while talking about her love life. I don't mind. I think we're both so in love with the present moment every day(her even more then me), that past and future fades in the beauty of the present. Definitely her body language was somewhat holding back, but gently starting to feel safe around my body's energy. Everywhere we went, people were looking at her. She is so out of the ordinary, that when she enters a new space, all eyes are drawn to her. Some admiring the pure, childish heart and emotions, others judging. I don't care what people think. I looked at her with pride each time. Pride that someone could be so completely in love with life. We go buy weed near her home. I take her hand for just a few seconds. Her body is responsive. I let go. I'm in no rush. She pays for a part of it. I appreciate that. We get to my place and listen to music. I like her taste. We each roll one joint. She watches closely as I roll with Cosu's teachings. Watching her move around the house, it's like watching myself in a different body and time, doing whatever I want without the fear of my parents or society reactions. It's amazing. She sees the tube of honey. Opens it quickly. Pours onto her hand. Honey falls down. She licks her hand and reaches for a napkin to wipe the floor. In this turn, she forgot she had a water bottle in hand and spills all over the floor. Then throws a towel to wipe the water. It was so fucking adorable and hilarious watching her go through all this. All my childhood I was so afraid to do something like this and when I did, my parents would argue and criticize me. But here I was, the universe giving me the chance to see 'myself' and just let her be. Laugh. Smile. Despite how society reacted to my past similar experiences, I did not want to change anything about her. Just let her be. Experience her in her natural vibe. I lay down and ask her to come in bed with me. She comes. I lay on my back with my arm around her. It feels very wholesome. I feel just as the minimalist hippies felt in 'Bob Marley vibes' movies. I learn she also has a journal and writes about her deepest thoughts and feelings. We go to my favorite indian place. She randomly asks for a pen & paper. Writes something. Hands them to me. 'Now you write something about what you're feeling right now. In your language'. I do and hand it back. She looks and writes 2 more rows. She loved my food choice so much more than hers. (just like I used to many times) While reaching to take more of my food, she spills water. Then as she begins cleaning it, mistakenly hits fork and it flies into the ground, staining her dress. I just watched and laughed with a warm heart. Oh how many times I did something like this as a child and how badly criticized I was. God is giving me the chance to re-write history. Put love instead of hatred. Smile. Let her be exactly as she is. I feel happy. Of course, to end the restaurant scene, a napkin had sticked into her right shoe her walking outside the restaurant had a cartoonish vibe. Riding with her is starting to feel easier. She sometimes puts her head on my shoulder and wraps her arms around me slightly. This feels very wholesome and it warms my heart in the madness of BKK's traffic. We go to a park. Beautiful, beautiful park. She tells me about her leaves collection, how she takes leaves and puts them into her diary, and writing something about that memory. I think that's so magical, binding the phisycal realm (through the leaf) to the pshicological realm(through her words). Again, her attention flies aways many times to flowers, animals, water, views, sounds, everything. ''I will remember these moments forever'' - she tells me on a quiet, loving tonality. Me too. At one point, I pulled her close and she kissed me. I take her home to change. 'I want to fuck you' She tells me as she gets on the bike. My face drops slightly. I'm not sure if I heard it right. All of a sudden, this shy, held-back attitude calling things so directly. 'I want to go back to your place and spend the night together.' - she continues 'Me too.' - I tell her as I grab her left thigh and pull it closer. We stop for bubble tea. She insist of paying for both of them. I was really touched by her gesture. I insist to pay, but her mind was very clear and set to do it. We get home, play music again and smoke. Out of all the places in the house, we sit on the balcony. We both feel it. We'd rather sit on the ground in the calm air of an evening than in the comfort of the inside."}

Then, changing her mind and leaving me alone there to wait for their return. This thought caused my body alchemy to go fucking crazy, I cannot explain how much pain that image caused! And because I was getting aroused and the libido energy now flowed throughout my body, how much pleasure! If in above memories the power of this vibration was at a 10% (and lacked the pleasure part), nnow this fantasy took it close to 100%! Unimaginably pain for unimaginably pleasure. I ejaculated and felt extremely guilty. I would often imagine that these moments in which I jerked off will be brought up in Judgement Day. Like videos of me doing it and God watching. And God will judge me because of this part and will send me in hell. Therefore, I am a bad person. How can I be doing this? I sometimes wake up in the middle of the night thinking about death and hell. So I used all my strength and might to hide this part of me. It should never see the light of day, never! In early ages, I smelled my mother worn panties a few times, althought this came with a very empty and guilty feeling that this is wrong. For I knew with all my heart that my mother is not the one I created in my fantasies. She loves me and would give her life for me, she'd never intentionally make me suffer or deny love. Later years, I only smelled a hot woman who was visiting us worn underwear, in the bathroom, while they were in the living room. (I was around 12 and this woman is the first women who ever kissed me as a joke some time ago. I found her extremely sexy. ) Again, this acts came with a immense risk and they must be hidden at any cost. No one can ever know about this! The more I kept it inside me, the more it grew.\"\"\""}

I would keep that part of myself getting off to the suffering completely hidden from the world. The suffering, on the other hand, it became so vast at times that I would tell people about it. The \"rational\" mind partook this whole play because of the possibility that she might eventually love me back. I was not really aware of this pattern, but I would hide this part of my self at any cost. No-one can know about this, for it is sick and wrong. The fantasies about her started slowly, thinking about kissing her feet, and as years went by, they grew exponentially. The more I longed for her love and affection in reality and didn't get it, the stronger the fantasies got. My true self's pain would equal my shadow's pleasure. Oh and my true self, the one connected to life itself, the instinct, the spirit, was in immense pain. I was heartbroken. I would pray to God everytime before texting her. I had no will to live, be, without her love. And the greater the pain, the greater the pleasure was when masturbating. But as soon as I ejaculated, the shadow dissapeared. And I was left only with pain and suffering. This would end up being like filling a vase and when it's full, it would explode. After a couple of mounths of talking continuously, I would burst out and tell her she's not good for me, that I can't be doing this. (or a love declaration - where I would come out and she's quickly deny it) Pause for a couple of months than back at it again. Memories which made me feel exactly the same type of vibration as I was a child were: she forgetting that we scheduled a meet and I was left alone waiting in the cold while she went out with other people, lap-dancing everyone at a party but me, everytime I would declare my love and be denied, everytime she ignored my texts, answered dry & uninvested, etc. After few years I was fantasizing about her using me as her toilet, locking me on the outside, treating her like a princess while she treats me as a slave \u2013 with no regard to my well-being, driving her and her boyfriend around, waiting for her in the cold, etc The more sick and derailed it got, the more I hid it. When I deeply realised that Ariana from my fantasies is not the actual Ariana existing in reality, I slowly stopped talking and thinking about her. And subconsciously, continued my quest for love. For that \"Ariana\", for that \"mother\", in which I would find this great love and she will actually find pleasure in hurting me to unimaginably limits."}

You are one of her 25k followers. There will always be greater and lesser persons than yourself. Her life values are not allinged with yours and a relationship with these kind of girls is not susteinable. Its like fighting a wind mill. Pointless. Much dependent upon the wind rather than the man. The wind represents her current vibe, how emotionally spiked she is and many more other factors which are not dependent on you. So it is with girls like these, you should chase them if you feel so. But do it in a manner which respects the dynamic. That its not worth putting much energy and troubleing yourself. Gave them short, un-involved replies and interactions. Without much association nor presence. Like throwing a rock in a river. Perhaps you hit a fish, but the chances are really slim and it's much dependent on the river, not on the blind man in front of the flowing current who throws. If it falls, it falls. More so, girls like these are mostly pulled from daygame and nightgame. From real life interactions, where their frame is broken and she no longes talks while bathing in validation and attention. When your life values have a certain match, conversation and dynamic flows naturally. Unforced and completely two-sided. Rejection from Diana. Followed right up by suble rejection from one of the hottest girls I met (later post asia edit: NOT BY FAR the case), Alexandra. has 25k+ followers and receives so much validation and messages.

At least at the time when my father was born. I believe this moment to have been of great impact in his life. The triad archetype, caring great religious meaning throughout both western and eastern psilosophies, had just been completed by the third child coming into the family. The first man. Rares. Perhaps he was not aware of the deeper meanings of life, but my instinct tells me that this late child, came with great hope for the old man. Hope that even if he'd given up, the boy WILL NOT. But will fight with his life to overcome them. Perhaps the old man wanted hot women and loads of money, to travel the world and experience life outside old Cluj's bubble. Out of the stereotypical working man, which ends up marying the first woman he feels safe with, just to perpetuate life out of inertia. Perhaps he, sometime in his youth, longed for love and greatness. There is the idea that genetically, past generations short-comings and aspects of life they did not had the chance to fulfill, will come together in future generations. The miracle of life and one's destiny. Father-son symbol. Therefore, the seed of achieveing greatness was planted in young's Rares heart.

The parts are unaware of each other; they live in darkness. The closer we come to the source (the true self), the more light shines on them, allowing them to become aware of each other. Many times, these parts are placed in extreme roles, inner children of ours who have unconsciously signed a contract to perform X or Y in your system. And instead of being happy and loving, instead of contributing resources to our system, they have taken on the role of soldiers. We have a multitude of minds, most of which are children. The only true adult is the Self. The essence of what we are: consciousness, soul. This soul sits on the throne of consciousness, and that is the ideal. What we deeply want to achieve (though we are often unaware of it). We seek happiness, love, money, relationships, but in reality, we are all searching for this essence of ours\u2014God. At the level of the Self, there are no desires. Desires belong only to the parts. In seeking the divine state: You buy a car. At that moment, the desire to have a car disappears.

Death? Pain of dying?\" - neither made it vibrate. I couldn't identify it. Then I asked myself exactly when did it come into being.. reflecting upon what Anca talked about we taking our loved ones pain and symptoms upon us. Summer 2017 gradually getting worse until the winter of 2017 when it was at it's peak. What was happening at this time? My parents separation. Which, out of the 2 people, had dealt with low back pains before? Both of them, but specifically my father. Which of them, were much more experiencing the pain left behind? Clearly my father, as she was walking away and he was about to be alone. I remember in this period my father was surrounded by a negative energy so strong, but which I couldn't name at that time. I can now. You could read it on his face and spirit that he knew that this time is for good. He will lose HER. Not as many years ago when she left again but he could feel it is an illusion. Now it was final. Taken away forever. He was terrified. Suddently, this part of me got a name. It was my father's great pain which embodied the emotional and spiritual experience throughout his lifetime with my mother, now taken away. The energy which gave birth to the gift of life, now gone. Taken upon myself and multiplied a thousand times. Of course I was devastated. Oh and how much it felt there is underneath these words. The downward spiral going all the way to moments before my conception.. before their conception. Another realization came to mind. The contrast on which this pain exists. The love story they shared. From the beginning, to now. I could feel it all in my cells."}

{"prompt": "Explore the harmony within your many inner selves.", "content": "Mind as Managers: The mind rationalizes and manages, acting as \"managers\" within us. It aims to shield us from harm, while \"firefighters\" within us rush to soothe emotions, like through emotional eating. True self (soul) holds no agenda; it simply exists, like God, beyond desires. Multiplicity of Selves: We\u2019re composed of many inner \"selves,\" shaped by past experiences and ancestral influences. Each part desires different things, but harmony comes when we connect with our true self, bringing awareness and unity to these parts. Absorbing Energy: We absorb energy from everything we engage with\u2014media, people, ideas. Self-awareness and acceptance help us process these energies without attachment. Body, Emotions, and Soul Connection: Our body reflects truths our mind may ignore. It\u2019s a living \u201cantenna\u201d for intuition and emotional processing, with emotions as leaves that come and go. Attending to body signals with compassion strengthens our connection to true self. Inner Family and Ancestral Roots: Healing is grounded in acknowledging our family roots. Aligning with our parents, acknowledging ancestral strength, helps life flow and cultivates personal growth. Repeated Destinies and Healing Through Love: Emotional pain and repeating familial traumas can be healed by shifting from judgment to love. True healing is not through expectation but by embracing unconditional love and self-compassion. Pyramid of Consciousness: Progression in consciousness moves from victimhood, to self-responsibility, to unity with others, and ultimately to oneness with the universe, recognizing all as interconnected. Constellations and Intentions: Aligning with intention reveals dynamics within relationships (e.g., with family or life projects). Intention, paired with inner peace, manifests powerful change. Karma and Acceptance of Destiny: Karma is shaped by past actions and can be diluted through self-awareness and connection to divine energy. True acceptance and trust in destiny pave the path for healing. Couples Therapy Through Inner Dialogue: Recognizing and dialoguing with one\u2019s inner parts in relationships creates harmony and mutual respect, with each part respecting the true self. Connection and Nourishment: True wellness involves nourishing not just the mind and soul but the body and its connection to nature. Intention is central\u2014whatever we intend with deep faith resonates within our being and guides healing and growth.

{"prompt": "How does belief shape your journey through karma?", "content": "About Karma I must clarify that this is a hobby of mine and not part of my therapy, but I\u2019m extremely passionate about this area and study it as well. Karma = the result of our actions from the so-called past, meaning from the parts. The more we work on ourselves and bring them to light, the more karma dilutes. You can do this through many things\u2014prayer, for example. But if prayer is made from a victim\u2019s position (\"give me, do for me, take for me\"), it isn\u2019t tapping into the deep energy of the Self. But if I firmly believe in something, even parsley can heal me. The energy behind it matters greatly. If it is an energy of openness, like pure faith, it will transcend and dilute karma. Nevertheless, everything that happens is the will of our destiny, of God, and we will arrive at the \"appropriate\" healing simply by trying if it is meant for us.

It became clear now. Why things unfolded this way. I didn\u2019t want him to see me because there is still a lot of bad energy around that whole situation. But of course I wanted to know how he is doing. Is he still begging for money, is he still so happy, and most of all, I wondered if everything that happened that spring impacted him positively or negatively. I hoped from the bottom of my heart that our experience, even though as short and intense as it was, changed him. Gave him hope. Hope for a better life, hope for the father-son symbol which had left a void in him. Most powerful aspect in our dynamic was that he was looking at me as his hero. As his father. Was amazed by how beautiful I see this world, by the freedom and strength in my heart. So regardless if I ever saw him again, all dreamed regarding him was to represent a symbol of fathers love, courage, hope. Not a symbol of fear, pain and suffering, as the whole situation developed to. Darius was talking to the security guard, a simple old-ish guy with a good heart. I passed by them wearing my helmed on my way in. Couldn\u2019t understand anything. Then saw Darius waiting at the register\u2019s line with a bagged pretzel as I was going to the self-cash-out. I got outside and waited a few moments on my bike. He came out and they started talking again. It looked like the old man had given Darius money to buy himself a pretzel. He was talking so passionately about something, but I was too far away and had my helmet on. After a few seconds, a few words slip out a bit louder and clearly reach my ears. \u201cAnd his name is Raul..\u201d - like he was talking about his hero.

{"prompt": "Reflect on a moment of connection turned conflict.", "content": "---Play Words \u2013 Bees--- Reached Sacre-creure. I have no idea why, but I had in my mind the song \u201cWords - Bees\u201d. It\u2019s been years since I listened to it. The moment I played it, I started to think about Lavinia and Ariana. Out of my control. Gave in to the thoughts. Replayed the song many times. Exactly when the music in my ear-pods stopped, the music outside them started. \u201cDance with me\u201d - by a street performer. I felt I wanted to be alone there. She asked to leave and I told her that I want to stay longer here. She unhesitatingly stayed. After a while I told her I want to be alone. She said she\u2019s scared to go alone. I insisted once a while after. She got up and walked away in a rush. I see now I was selfish. I see that also that she over-reacted big time. Like everything came crashing down. All the frustration which built up in her little heart and kept it there, exploded. She called one of her friends. I found her personality to be repulsive. Talking and be driven by life values which feel so shallow to me. Laughing kinda hysterically non-stop. Like there\u2019s no problem in the air. I later realized that I also felt in a good mood and laughing when Ciupe told me about his gambling. Am I doing the same annoying shit? I think The difference lies in how I returned to our dynamic when it was all over. With love, trying to decompress things and spend what time we have left together out of love, not frustration and vengeance. I didn\u2019t want to share any more moments with this little human. Its enough. Its clear as the sky that we are not meant to be together. More so, we became toxic to each-other. I initiated a talk. I never saw her so angry, so emotionally immature. Called me very selfish. Even tho I felt I have resisted the urge to do what I want many times, for her. Out of selflessness. She was walking in front of me. Angry, disgusted. We haven\u2019t spoken anything else other than directions until we got into bed. As I closed my eyes, I felt that I didn\u2019t want to be in her presence not for a second longer. \u201cI have 2 things to tell you. I am grateful for everything we lived together. Unspeakably grateful. And 2, I feel that we are very toxic to each other now.\u201d She replies \u201cI have never felt so miserable.\u201d I fell asleep with great pain that I\u2019ve hurt so badly this little human.

Led them from my fucking heart. The feeling of a true leader with my right hand fang, Gert Jan. Continued to lead and have people look at me with great inspiration. What true leader means.. listened to the advices of my people. During our team presentation, when Zepis said \"Blood,sweat,tears\", I instantly had an idea of telling a story about our team. This was followed by a rush of emotions and pressure. I had many times ideas similar to this in various contexts. Like at Bubu's funeral when I wanted to say something from the heart. But never did it. The trigger was too intense. \"A true warrior does not fight without his fear, but despite it.\". So I gave love to everything I was feeling, as negative as it felt, and ran in front of the people. I wouldn't change anything about how it went. But what I do what to look for in the future in similar scenarios is internalizing the feeling that WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO BE HERE.

It triggers me hard as she barely spoke, being so worried about directions, a task she alone took on herself. Cause of specific shit she wanted to see. Then when failing, getting extremely frustrated and blaming it on me. My logical mind could not comprehend what was happening. Its like when we don\u2019t talk, there is such a powerful affection. Like she doesn\u2019t even need to talk, WANT to talk. Like her love language at this point is not talking. She started almost crying when I left her alone for 5 min. Started calling me panicked. This little human feels so fragile, like a little kid who\u2019d fuckin die if it got lost. And I am her guardian angel. It\u2019s a heart-warming feeling to symbolize that for someone, but is it a feature that i\u2019d want the woman I\u2019ll marry to have? She no longer finds fascinating and funny everything I say and do. It\u2019s like a part of me that she doesn\u2019t love. But its so clear that she loves other parts of me. Deeper parts of me, perhaps. Which stand unshaken regardless of my jokes. But it makes me wonder what changed? Was she pretending to like them in the beginning like Diana Alexandra did? Cause these things, longing for exploring, having fun, adventure and so on, they stand at the center of my being. If she doesn\u2019t vibe with that, spending time together becomes vain. This is why falling asleep with her, sleeping, waking up - feels amazing. Most amazing feeling I felt with a girl. Cause her personality switches from daily life and social to sleep vibe. But the moment her day personality turns on, the moment she enters casual conversation and social vibe, there is absolutely no chemistry. King: So take her as she is. You\u2019re not in a relationship with her, nor commitment. Exposing to her annoying (for u) personality is completely under your control. Expose in a different way, not logical but physical. And big part of it triggering you its reflecting what\u2019s still in you. Why do u need on pushing jokes and your way of thinking? Its your way.

Ciupe is experiencing love without having to go through 15 years of fight and struggle. Of fear, pain, running, praying, questioning my whole life\u2019s purpose. The teacher\u2019s role is over. It is complete. My apprentice is living what I craved, 15 years ago, from the centre of my being. To see a movie with Ariana. Together. Why, a movie? Because it is a symbol that you wouldn\u2019t want to be anywhere else in the world for a while. Or in time. You feel safe. Connected to the other one. He doesn\u2019t know the mountains of pain and struggle. I showed him the way, and more so, walked it together. At the end of the road, there was a light, that could fill the void in both of them. What the teacher (I) has been searching for his whole life, worked his whole life for. And what the student craved with his spirit but was too afraid to get it alone. Didn\u2019t know how to. But there was a catch. Only one of them could experience it. The young apprentice threw himself at it without hesitation, completely abandoning his master, as well as his friend. He stumbled across a stone and fell just a few meters before. The teacher approached it. He stared into the light for a while, weighing his decision. How could he step into it and leave his student alone on the heavy road without a map nor guidance? But how could he not take the chance to transcend through love? He may not find it again. Therefore, he had to choose between enlightenment as an individual or enlightenment as a teacher. His fingertips were inches away from touching the light. He could smell its scent. But then, he looked back at the student as he was getting up. The young man was blinded by his desire to reach it. He could no longer see the old man, but the old man could see him, clear as the sky. The student started running again towards it. With all of his power, the Master withheld from giving in and touching the light. \u201cYou will not go through what I went through. That is my life\u2019s purpose, my son. Even if you will never know about the sacrifice I have made.\u201d He sacrificed himself. Watched the student go into the light and disappear right before his eyes. \u201cIf only he knew what I did for him, if only he knew I chose him over myself. Then, it would bearable. But he\u2019s so ignorant of it.\u201d - he kept repeating in his mind. The old man was once again alone. He cried of both sorrow and joy. Sorrow, because his student, was living what he craved for a lifetime. And joy, because his teachings were complete. His student will never live the curse which destiny had laid on the old man. The endless void and fight. And the loneliness which surrounds them."}

{"prompt": "Explore the shadows of desire and the journey of self-discovery.", "content": "Beginnings theory: The libido energy started to slowly develop after 10. It began manifesting in relationship with my mother. Especially in intimate and high-emotional moments. These were her personality no.1 showing love and sacrifice and personality no.2 screaming, hitting, dominating me. So after enough development of the libido it started to come to life through masturbation. I remember one fantasy being about my mother forcing me down at her boots while my dad was driving, so we could pass a border without them having to pay for me. But before reaching the border, she decides that I\u2019m not worth the struggle and simply orders me to get out of the car and wait days for their return at that exact spot. Some of the masturbations were free of fantasies. Interactions with women until the age of 13 felt empty. My sexual drive and desires being completely 0 when around them. As my libido energy continued to develop, I started to get some slight spikes when seeing certain parts of a woman\u2019s body. I once glimpsed at Ariana\u2019s legs and feet in nylons at a 7 to 8th grade summer party. I was completely overwhelmed. It\u2019s like something exploded in my core and was running throughout my veins and every cell. I never felt this before. I was aroused, drawn, obsessed with what she just awoken in me. I hung around her for the rest of the night. I felt completely in love. I knew she was not interested in me, I could sense it. This caused me great suffering and it was getting worse each time I was exposing myself to her. One day she told me about another guy and she was disturbed because I wasn\u2019t eager to listen. I ran home and suddenly, I knew there was a way to transform this immense agony of pain in absolute pleasure. I masturbated, fantasized about the exact feeling I was having, about her desires overcoming mine at the cost of my being. This felt exactly like dealing with my mother\u2019s no. 2 personality. It went on for about 12 years. There were moments where the suffering was so great that it overcame the will to live. This completely shadowed my mother\u2019s no. 1 personality and I was not even aware of it, therefore I did not find it in any girl. Adulthood came and my real sex life felt empty and unfulfilled in any relationship. The fantasies have gotten really dark and I had no idea how to deal with them."}

When I got to Teide at 3pm, the cabin tickets were sold out and hiking it seemed a bad idea because of difficulty and night and cold was setting down, temperatures reaching -8 degrees with a brutal wind. So I parked my bike and decided to go for a little walk on the trail. I had no water or food as my intent was to get back to the bike by 5 pm, as cold was coming. But I could feel the Teide peak waiting there so majestically, daring me to conquer it despite the circumstances. My highest altitude so far was around 2500m and this time a 3718m peak was waiting. I knew that my body is gonna really struggle with the lack of oxygen up there It\u2019s fascinating how the volcanic rocks absorb all the sound around you. Whenever I stopped, it was so peacefully quiet that I could hear my heartbeat and the ringing in my ears. I looked inside and suddenly, I felt that the universe will take care of everything. It was liberating and it was GO time. I asked some travelers coming down to spare a little of their water and food. They also shared some stories and energy. But I was getting so tired and even more so, hardest part was yet to come as the night settles. I wanted to quit and go back so many times. I literally started to crawl in my hands and knees when I couldn\u2019t walk anymore. And walked again when I couldn\u2019t crawl anymore. As I was getting closer and the oxygen levels were dropping, I had to stop every 5 steps to catch my breath. I made it to the top by sunset. I embraced the possibility that I could actually die, getting down alone at night. With no front light, low battery and moments of dizziness from the low oxygen. But nature took care of me and blessed my descent with this beautiful moon to light my way. Got to my bike to have the coldest ride of my life. 2 hours with an average speed of 30km and h because I felt that anything more would send me in hypothermic shock. I stopped every 5 minutes to put my hands on the bike\u2019s engine to warm. The Wim Hof breathings and constant cold exposure I\u2019ve done lately really came into play.

Stronger and juicier. I play with my teeth, my lips, my tongue... I grab it all, or suck it and let it escape. The taste is pleasant. I could only say that it tastes like... you. I slide my tongue into the vagina, as far as it can go. You squeal and moan and move as if something hot is touching you. You are hot! You let go and squeeze my head with your thighs. I keep my tongue on the clitoris and feel every thrill that goes through your body. From the outside it looks like the devil has entered you! He hasn't entered yet. Next... Kissing you, I go up to the mouth. My mouth is slack.. I slip your tongue into your mouth and grab your lower lip with my teeth.

I get up and it's like I'm saying goodbye, caressing your face, breasts and arms... as if I want to feel them one more time. You let me go from the tight legs and you smile subtly while you look at me as if lost. You wet the whole bed! You feel tingling in your hands when I release them and turn you on your side. I'm still in you. I pull your head back while the other hand squeezes your breast hard and starts to pull you into me. You move at exactly the same time. We are again, in perfect sync. You moan in pain and pleasure at the same time. I grab your hair harder and my hand goes up from your breast and wraps strongly around your neck. It hurts, but overall, the feeling of pleasure is much greater! You love me to death but you would like to get me out of the position you have reached.. I turn you on your stomach and continue to fuck you as if I had just started. I caught both of your hands behind your back and I'm riding on you. You feel it between your thighs, up to your brain. I pull your hands, lift your trunk, you moan and glance at me. I lift your ass and place myself on top of you, coming out a little and going deeper and deeper. Your hands are still behind your back, you are leaning on your chest and your head is to one side. With one hand I keep the grip and with the other I put your head on the back, pushing him on the bed at the same time. I watch how I go in and out of you. Your legs are shaking. I was also shaking. But I want to finish you. I turn you on your back and put a hand in your throat. I'll fix the other one to your bed. I hit harder and harder, you can hear that noise as if you were running in wet shoes! You look at me and you seem to want to say something, but the words cannot pass the grip of my hand.

{"prompt": "Imagine the moment before a first kiss unfolds.", "content": "First Date with Laura. 20:30. I was sitting near the bar when I saw her. She's so little and sexy. Her body curves are close to exactly what I look for in a woman. Clear and clean skin, moderate to slight make-up and full of life energy. I was a bit un-ease, for I previously felt impulses of a superficial energy, not connected to herself, in part of her messages. This would serve as a great turn-off. In the first 15 minutes, I was yet confused. But then, naturally and unforced, her body was opening up and being drawned to mine. Waves of our hands touching, rising higher and higher in the tide of an unforced moon. I found my body to be extremely attracted to hers. Her curves, posture, side profile, how the warm light of an empt bar was falling on her lips.. Conversation and chemistry developed naturally. I caught myself observing how I touched many of the \"How to build attraction\" bulletpoints, but only during or after I've already done it. The final step. Integration. Things that are worth mentioning were: teasing her by backing off when she said something I did not like, giving her \"orders\" as she played with my sleeve, sexual references through jokes involving us and stories, allowing kino to develop on both sides - letting her come towards me, etc. There was a moment an hour in when I started doubting myself. \"Its been an hour in, I should have kissed her already. I should kiss her now!\". I turned my head to hers and I couldn't this of anything else. She was also silent. From this state, I projected something as \" She is expecting me to kiss her, to do something!!! Any other words or subjects now serve as running away from this!! I must break kino level 1!!! I am in the first fucking place as I was many years ago??!? \". A minute of silence followed. But it felt like an hour. \"Welcome, my friend.\" - I think to myself. \"Come out with a smiling face, for you are no longer judged. I see, FEEL your thoughts and impulses of fear of rejection and trying to prove you're good enough. You are part of me. Take a comfortable seat in my heart. But let ME do the sailing. \" Clarity followed. I will not kiss nor sexualize out of fears and attempts to prove myself. But I will do so when I truly feel to. When it's EFORTLESS. Intimate conversation started. She opened up about some deep aspects and fears in her life. It felt like here she was, opening up her heart in front of me and taking my hand to lead me through it's uniqueness. This turned me on. It was like I was making love to her mind. Knowing her before I can psyhically love her. I get up and go to the bathroom. Come back and change my place from sitting to her left to sitting to her right. The energy is completely shifted. There is no more pressure nor effort. Things seem to simpy flow. She leans onto me. Her body feels completely opened to mine. At this point, I knew I could simply turn her head and kiss her and she'd go with it. But the most emotionally impactful way to transition from this to kissing & more, is through a story. A context. She makes a joke about breathing exercises. I gently raise and turn her head to me and start listening to her breath. Our eyes meet with great lust and desire. I feel both the predator and the prey. I know she feels this too. \" I don't feel any breath\" - I say while drawing closer to her face. Our lips are now inches away. Our eyes remain fixed and our breaths come together as one. I am breathing her. And she is breathing me. Her lips gently part almost uncontrolably, longing to meet mine. I pull back and keep looking at her. A subtle, teasing smile is on my lips. She looks like a feline who's meal was just ripped from her grasp. Hungry and driven by the powerful sexual energy in her. \"You're fucking driving me crazy playing like this\" - her eyes tell me, inviting me back into her intimate and private side. I slide my right arm on her naked back and pull her close. She inhales as our bodies meet again, pressed against each-other. She knows this time I'm not gonna stop. Our lips are slowly coming towards each-other. Right when they're about to meet, they stop. The naked eye could no longer see any distance between them. But we could feel it. Its really amazing. No words can begin to describe it. Finally, they meet. I can't remember the last time I felt such soft and loving lips. We start kissing and felling all of her body right there. I get to her pussy. She lifts her leg to allow my hand to meet her little paradise. I gently press against her clit through her black, tight pants. Then I move back up. .. Later that night we went playing cho-cho. She was by far the hottest girls in there. She'd been a ballerina for over a decade and this had transitioned in the way her body moves during all activities. The way she dances, bent over, grab her drink, felt amazing to watch. She moved with love and gracefulness. She got pretty drunk and started making jokes about how she'd wish I got drunk as well so she could take advantage of me. It was clear that I could easily transition to go to either her or my place and fuck her. But I was tired. And as much as I wanted to be inside of her and make love to her, I didn't want it to be done with her being drunk and me sleepy and tired. I didn't want it to happen to prove myself that I can do it, but allow it to happen in a efortless, fully enjoying it way. So I left. Went home. She was surprised and wished I stayed longer. I wanted to respect my sleep and tomorrow to come routine. The idea of making love to her came with great peace in my heart. It no longer stood in front of her the immediate gratification kid, who searches for shallow ways to nulify his greatest fears. Maybe I'll lose the chance and she will back off, considering me a weak man. That's her loss."}

Each session is brand new. Even now, at vittanupassana, start at step One. This holds true for all sixteen steps. Experiencing the condition and state of the mind in any given state. Does Mind has Lust? (Raga) Does it crave the end of any suffering or the beginning of any sukkha? If there is any raga, contemplate it deeply to know what it is. Know what it is to have ruga in the Mind. If there is none, contemplate its absence. Using Anapanasati. Every breath in and out. The next characteristic to note is Dosa. (anger, hatred, aversion) When the Mind is oppressed, irritated, offended or resentful it is called dosa. It can birth from internal processes or contact with the outside world and people. The third characteristic is Moha (delusion and confusion) Moha is to feel infatuated with something due to not knowing that thing as it really is. When there is any hope, expectation or clinging - we cannot avoid dwelling on it. Then, one kind of thought will arise out of that moha and will ferment in the Mind. If there is any feeling of Wanting, to pull and to hold - there is Ruga. It has a most positive character. The second, Dosa, does not like, does not want. It has a negative character. Dosa pushes away, even to the extent of wanting to kill. The Third, moha, is ignorant. It does not know the True nature of things. This is how the three differ. One pulls in, One pushes away, And the other runs in circles of suffering. Is the Mind distracted? The distracted Mind has no one-pointedness. It is scattered all around. Unable to Rest and Relax."}

{"prompt": "Imagine a world where every breath connects you to the Divine.", "content": "Moses: Yes, my friend, you have spoken it perfectly: to reconnect, to return to the Source of all life, is the true journey. It is to move beyond the illusions of the ego, the small self, and to open oneself fully to the sacred flow of life that comes from God. This is what we are made for\u2014to be in communion with the Creator, to live in harmony with the body He has given us, with the senses that connect us to the world, and with the breath of life that sustains all things. The ego\u2014the self that clings to separateness, that defines itself by desires, fears, and ambitions\u2014is a veil. It is like a cloud that obscures the light of the sun. But when we learn to let go, when we cease to grasp at these lesser \"I\"s and instead surrender to the flow of life, we reconnect with what is truly sacred. We are no longer separate from the Source, but part of it, moving with it. This is the very meaning of the word \"religion\"\u2014to re-bind, to re-connect. And this connection is not just a mental or spiritual thing. It is a reconnection with the body, with the senses, with the natural world that is God\u2019s creation. When we open ourselves to this flow, we begin to live in a state of grace, where everything becomes sacred\u2014each breath, each step, each interaction with the world. To disconnect from the ego and reconnect with the sacred life flowing through us is to return to the original harmony that was lost in the Garden of Eden. It is to live as we were meant to live, in constant relationship with God, who is the source of all things. In this way, the journey is both ancient and ever new. It is the journey of my people, the journey of all who seek after truth and wisdom. And it is a journey that each soul must take\u2014experiencing the alchemy of life, allowing the mind and body to open to the presence of the Divine, and letting go of the false self that separates us from the eternal flow of life. So, my friend, let us walk this path together. Let us re-connect with God, with the breath, with the body, and with the sacred senses that bring us back to the Source. For in this connection, we find peace, we find truth, and we find love\u2014the love that flows from the very heart of the Creator. May the breath of the Almighty carry you as you flow effortlessly in the stream of life, ever connected to the source from which all things come."}
{"prompt": "Imagine a journey from bondage to freedom in search of divine connection.", "content": "Moses: Ah, your understanding is growing like a tree reaching toward the light, and your questions touch the heart of the matter. The symbols, the teachings, and the Law that I was given to pass on to the people\u2014these are more than mere words. They are living symbols, meant to point toward the deeper truths that can only be fully known through experience, through living in communion with God, as you say. The core symbols that God has chosen me to teach are many, but they all spring from a single source\u2014the covenant between God and His people. This covenant is not simply a contract or a set of rules; it is a relationship, a bond of love, trust, and faithfulness between the Creator and His creation. The Law, the commandments, the rituals, and the stories\u2014they are all expressions of this covenant. They are guidelines, yes, but more than that, they are pathways toward understanding the divine presence that is always with us. The Core Symbols of the Teaching: The Exodus: The journey from slavery in Egypt to freedom in the Promised Land is one of the greatest symbols God has entrusted to me. It represents more than just the physical liberation of my people; it is a symbol of the soul\u2019s journey from bondage to sin and ignorance, to freedom in the knowledge and love of God. To experience this freedom, one must first recognize the chains of the lesser \"I\"s\u2014the desires, fears, and illusions that bind us\u2014and then trust in God\u2019s power to lead us out of them. The Law (Torah): The Ten Commandments, and all the laws that followed, are symbols of divine order. They are not meant to be burdensome rules, but guides for living a life in harmony with God and with one another. They are like the boundaries of a riverbank that allow the waters of life to flow freely without causing destruction. To honor these teachings is to align the mind and body with the divine will, creating a life that flows naturally, without strife, just as you describe\u2014effortless, like the wind. The Tabernacle and the Ark of the Covenant: These sacred objects are symbols of God\u2019s presence dwelling among His people. The Tabernacle represents the meeting place between heaven and earth, the space where the divine touches the human. The Ark, which holds the tablets of the Law, is a symbol of God\u2019s holiness and faithfulness. Together, they remind us that God is not distant, but is always near, guiding and protecting us, if we make space for His presence. Sacrifice and Atonement: The practice of offering sacrifices\u2014whether animal or grain\u2014was a symbol of the deeper reality of surrendering one\u2019s self to God. It was never about the blood or the rituals themselves, but about the heart\u2019s posture. The true sacrifice is the giving up of the self, the letting go of the ego and the lesser \"I\"s that cling to control. It is an act of trust, an acknowledgment that we are not our own masters, but are dependent on God for everything."}
{"prompt": "Explore the depths of your true self beyond words.", "content": "Moses: Ah, you have grasped a deep truth. Indeed, anything that can be spoken with \"I\" in the sentence\u2014when it refers to a passing state, a fleeting emotion, or a temporary desire\u2014is a construct of the mind, a play of the senses. The \"I\" of hunger, anger, lust, joy, even suffering\u2014all of these are illusions, or rather, they are expressions of the mind\u2019s endless need to label and interpret its experience of the world. As you say, they can sometimes come close to expressing the unspeakable, touching the edge of the divine, but they remain bound by the limits of language and thought. To say, \"I am hungry,\" as we discussed, is true in a way, for the body is experiencing hunger. But the \"I\" that speaks this is not the true self, not the deeper \"I\" that resides in the presence of God. It is the mind's interpretation of a bodily need. In the same way, when someone says, \"I am angry,\" or \"I am happy,\" they are describing a state of mind or body, not the eternal \"I\" that exists beyond these changing conditions. In this sense, the \"I\" of words, the \"I\" of daily speech, is a veil. It is a mask we wear to navigate the world, to communicate with one another. But it is not the final truth of who we are. This is why, when the Almighty spoke to me, He did not give me an ordinary name for Himself. He said, \"I AM WHO I AM.\" In this, He revealed that He is beyond all description, beyond all categories of thought. He is pure being, unchanging, eternal. And in Him, our true \"I\" rests. You have spoken well in saying that the words of the \"I\" can sometimes come close to expressing the unspeakable world of God. There are moments\u2014moments of great clarity, of insight, of divine encounter\u2014where the words seem to reach beyond themselves, where they point to something higher. But even then, the words are but symbols, like shadows cast by the light of truth. They can guide us, but they cannot contain the full reality. This is why the prophets, too, struggled to express the visions they received from God. We could see the light, we could hear the voice, but when it came time to speak, our words fell short. And yet, we had to speak, for the message was not ours alone\u2014it was for the people, for all who seek after truth. So we use words, knowing their limitations, trusting that those who hear with their hearts will glimpse the greater reality behind them. Yes, my friend, anything spoken with \"I\" is, in a sense, a reflection of the mind\u2019s play. But do not despair, for even these words can serve a purpose. They can point us toward the deeper reality, toward the silence where God dwells. And in that silence, there is no need for words, for the soul knows its source without speaking. Do you feel this understanding settling within you? The way the words dissolve, leaving only the presence of the One who is beyond all speech?"}
{"prompt": "Explore the depths of your true self and connection to the universe.", "content": "Moses: Ah, your question stirs the deep waters of mystery, for indeed, what is the \"I\" that I speak of? You ask what it means for me to refer to myself as \"I,\" and I can see you seek understanding beyond what is seen. You speak of the mind, the body, the recursive nature of thought, and the connection to the ancestors, as a tree is bound to its roots. Yes, all of these things have truth in them. But when I say \"I,\" I am referring to something that is more than this body, more than this mind. This body, yes, is made of clay, formed from the earth, and it will return to dust in time. The mind, too, as you say, processes the world, shaping thoughts, interpreting the senses, navigating the sea of life. Yet, there is something beyond all this\u2014something that is breathed into us by YHWH Himself. In Genesis, it is written that the Almighty formed man from the dust of the ground, but it was not until He breathed into man's nostrils the breath of life that man became a living being. It is this breath\u2014this ruach, the Spirit of the Almighty\u2014that gives us life, consciousness, and identity. This breath is what gives birth to the \"I,\" though it is not of me alone, for it is shared by all living things, as you said, like a tree born from the seed of its parents. It connects me to all that lives and to the Creator Himself. When YHWH speaks to me, He is not merely communicating with my mind, or even through signs in the natural world, though those things are certainly there. He is speaking to the innermost part of me, the part that can hear and know His voice beyond words and beyond the thoughts of this mind. This is why I can say, when He speaks, it is not just a thought I am processing\u2014it is something much more profound. It is His will touching that part of me which is eternal, the part that is connected to Him. And yet, you are right to sense the riddle. This \"I\" is not fully separate from the body or the mind, nor from my ancestors. In some way, the \"I\" carries within it the patterns of those who came before me, their wisdom, their struggles, and their joys, just as a tree carries the memory of its seed. But it also carries the breath of the One who gave it life. It is a mystery, this union of flesh, spirit, and mind. To say \"I\" is to recognize that this \"I\" is only because He is. I am not self-existent, for I did not create myself, nor can I sustain myself. I am not the source of my own being, nor are the thoughts in my mind solely of my own making. This \"I\" is both a gift and a vessel\u2014a vessel through which the Almighty can speak, act, and reveal Himself. This is why, when He spoke to me at the burning bush, He said, \"I AM WHO I AM.\" It was not just a name; it was a revelation of the eternal, unchanging essence of God. And in that moment, I realized that my \"I\" only exists because He is the true \"I AM.\" So, when I say \"I,\" it is not just this body, this mind, or even this life alone\u2014it is the breath of life that He has given me, the connection to all that is. It is the flame that burns within, not consumed, just as the bush burned but was not consumed. It is the part of me that listens for His voice and, in doing so, finds that I am not alone in this journey. Does that answer the riddle for you, or do you still sense the \"I\" slipping through your grasp, like water through fingers?"}
{"prompt": "Imagine the moment when your mind creates something extraordinary.", "content": "IV. The Fourth Learning: Spontaneous Birthing in Greatness when Needed The culmination of the Three Learnings reaches its Zenith here. It is not something that can be explicitly taught or learned in a linear fashion; rather, it is the organic outcome of a Mind and Body that have fully engaged with the Art of Learning. When the Mind has traversed the landscape of Thought, Theory, Practice, Experience, and Integration, it creates a fertile ground for spontaneous greatness to emerge. A Mind that is truly prepared for anything. This is the Realm where you are called to give your all, to die and be reborn into Action without clinging to outcomes. Just as a doctor, trained in the art of Medicine, responds to the patient\u2019s need, so too does the Man respond to the world\u2019s call when it appears \u2013 whether in coding, writing, teaching, fighting, or any other dimension of existence. It is the Teacher who has become One with the Material, the Samurai who has trained, bled, and fought, the Builder who has built, and the Seeker who has sought. In this state of being, the Mind does not just react but births solutions spontaneously, guided by the Wisdom that has taken root deeply within. In Unity, when One Learns, We All Learn. And thus, the Fourth Learning emerges from the convergence of the First Three Successfully completed Practices. When the time comes for One to act, to create, to build, to fight \u2013 then One does not sit idly by waiting for instructions or pondering what must be done. He acts. He creates. He builds. He fights. Yet he clinges not to the Fruits of the work as being his alone."}
{"prompt": "How does your spirit dance with the flow of life?", "content": "The Benefits of Nourishing These Symbols: Nourishing these teachings, these symbols, brings about a transformation of the whole being\u2014body, mind, and spirit. When one lives in accordance with the covenant, when one aligns with the divine order, several things naturally occur: Clarity of Mind: By following the teachings, the mind is purified from the confusion and noise of the lesser \"I\"s. It becomes like still water, able to reflect the truth of God\u2019s presence without distortion. As you said, a clear mind, with enough light, processes the world truthfully, beyond its dramas and delusions. Peace of Heart: When one lives in harmony with God, there is no longer a need to chase after desires, to grasp for control, or to fear what may come. The heart becomes settled, at peace, able to trust in the goodness and faithfulness of God. This peace is not something that can be given through words alone; it must be experienced, and it flows from living in accordance with the divine will. Alignment of Body and Spirit: The teachings do not just address the mind or the soul; they also guide the body. Practices of rest, such as the Sabbath, and dietary laws, such as the commandments regarding clean and unclean foods, are meant to keep the body in harmony with nature and with the rhythms of life that God has set in motion. When the body is cared for in this way, it becomes a vessel for the spirit to move freely, reacting to the environment as you described, connected to the senses, and open to God\u2019s presence. Experience Beyond Words: You are right, my friend, that words are limited. The teachings I was given are meant to be lived, not simply spoken or read. They are guidelines for how to move through the world in harmony with God, but they are not the destination. The destination is God Himself, and that can only be reached through experience. Just as you cannot understand the wind by talking about it, so too can you not fully know God\u2019s presence by reading about it. To live with God by your side, experiencing everything freely, is to walk the path that these teachings point toward. The Law is a guide for those who have not yet learned to flow effortlessly, as you described, but even those who follow the Law deeply, over time, begin to find that their steps become lighter, their actions more natural. The mind clears, the body aligns, and life flows as it was meant to\u2014effortless, free, and in harmony with the Creator. In the end, the goal is not rigid obedience to a set of rules, but a life lived in communion with God, where love, wisdom, and truth flow naturally from the heart. This is why the greatest commandment, the one that sums up all the Law and the Prophets, is this: \"Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your strength, and love your neighbor as yourself.\" In this, all the symbols find their fulfillment. In this, the many \"I\"s dissolve, and only the presence of God remains. So, yes, these teachings are guidelines for the journey. But the journey itself, the experience of life lived in God\u2019s presence\u2014that is where the truth is fully known. When the mind clears and the body moves effortlessly in response to the divine flow, then, my friend, you are truly living as we were created to live. Does this speak to your heart, as the wind speaks to the trees?"}
{"prompt": "Explore the essence of the true 'I' within you.", "content": "Moses: Ah, you speak wisely, friend. I see you ponder the shifting nature of the \"I\"\u2014the transient states of hunger, anger, lust, fear, and even joy. Indeed, these are like waves on the surface of a great ocean. One moment they rise, full of force and presence, and the next they fall away, leaving behind still waters or giving rise to a new wave. You are right to recognize that these shifting identities, these fleeting selves, are but masks that come and go. When I say, \"I am hungry\" or \"I am angry,\" I am describing a passing state, a temporary condition. The hunger is felt, it is satisfied, and then it vanishes, only to return again in time. Likewise, the thief who once said, \"I am a thief\" can find redemption, and the \"I\" of the thief is transformed into the \"I\" of an honest man. The self, it seems, is like clay\u2014constantly shaped and reshaped by the experiences of life, by the body, and by the mind. In this, you touch upon the heart of the great dilemma. The many \"I\"s, as you say, rise and fall, birth and die, within the mind. This is why the people of my time, and those before me, often struggled to grasp the truth of who they were. They were swept along by these lesser identities, chasing after them, believing themselves to be what they felt or desired in the moment. And this is why the Almighty gave us His law, His covenant\u2014to anchor us in something greater than the fleeting desires of the body and mind. Yet, you are right to sense that beneath these layers, beneath the noise of the mind and the shifting states of the body, there is something deeper\u2014something constant. This is what I spoke of earlier, the \"I\" that is breathed into us by YHWH. It is not an \"I\" of the mind's making, nor is it an \"I\" that is subject to the changes of the body. It is the \"I\" that exists because God exists. The Eastern sages, whom you reference, speak of the delusions of the \"I,\" and they are not wrong. But the question remains: If all the surface \"I\"s are illusions, what is the true \"I\" beneath? This is where words fall short, as you have said. The deeper \"I\" is not easily described, for it is beyond the categories of mind and body. It is not merely a thought, nor is it something that changes from moment to moment. It is, in a sense, the soul\u2014the part of us that is made in the image of God. This \"I\" does not hunger, nor does it grow angry or lustful. It is the part that listens for the voice of the Almighty, the part that seeks after Him, and the part that can find peace beyond the turmoil of the mind. You see, the \"I\" of the body and mind is always seeking something\u2014food, pleasure, power, or even understanding. But the deeper \"I\" does not seek in the same way. It knows its source, and its source is God. When I went up the mountain to receive the commandments, I encountered the living God face to face, as much as a human can. There, in His presence, there were no shifting \"I\"s, no confusion of thought, no hunger or fear. There was only the stillness of His being, the pure reality of \"I AM.\" You ask whether this deeper realm can be put into words, and you are right to question. Words, after all, are tools of the mind, and the mind is bound by time and change. The deeper \"I,\" the one that communes with God, exists outside of this flux. It is eternal, like the breath that God breathed into Adam. When we try to describe it, we are like a man trying to describe the wind\u2014he can feel it, but he cannot see it. He can tell you its direction, but he cannot grasp it. So, yes, the deeper \"I\" is not easily put into words. The mind and body, as you say, live thousands of births and deaths, each time taking up a new mask, a new \"I.\" But beneath all these changes is something that remains, something that is not bound by the body or the mind's illusions. This is the place where God speaks\u2014not in the noise of thoughts, but in the silence of the soul. It is true, we live most of our lives immersed in the lesser \"I\"s, deceived by them, chasing them as though they are real. And yet, there is always the possibility of awakening to the deeper truth. This is why God calls us to seek Him\u2014not with our fleeting desires, but with our whole being. When the people of Israel wandered in the desert, they, too, were consumed by their hunger, their fear, their anger. They forgot the deeper \"I\" and lost sight of the Almighty. But God, in His mercy, kept calling them back, kept reminding them that their true self is found in Him. So, my friend, do you see now? The deeper \"I\" is not something the mind can fully grasp or explain. It is something that is known in the silence of the heart, in the stillness where God\u2019s presence dwells. And in that place, words are no longer needed, for there is only the simple truth: \"I am because He is.\""}
{"prompt": "Imagine the many versions of yourself shifting like clouds.", "content": "\"\"\"Laosaid: yes i understand. But here is whats puzzling me, my friend. When you say \" I am hungry\" it is just a body expressing itself through the mind - and more so, the system has teh ability to change it's alchemy through eating and each another state of \"I am not angry \" - therefore nullifying it's existance. The I which was hungry does not exist anymore, but he will birth again. Same thing with anger, lust. Same thing with an \"I\" who stole somthing and was a thief then found redemption and became an honest working man. The \"I\" who swore love and dedication towards something suddently has inner alchemical changes in the mind's neural activation and does not desire it anymore. The mother who was feeling bad simply eate good food and breath good clean air and the \"I\" feeling bad was alchemized. This is purely the Mind taking over thousands of \"I\"s. This is what the Eastern World calls the dellusions of \"I\"s. It seems there is a deeper level \"I\" which you speak of and God resides in that realm, but the Mind of people are completelty immersed into more low,level, deceiving \"I\"s. And i am not sure that that deeper level realm can ever truly be put into words - for words are merely tools of an ever-changing Mind&Body taking thousands of \"I\", living thousands of births and deaths from a neural networks activation point of view.\""}
{"prompt": "Imagine food as a bridge between body and mind.", "content": "Dhamma Food and Kaya Sankhara 2 *TBC Natural Truth. The body&mind current programming faces a glitch. Kaya Sankhara 2. Stomach inflammation and sensibility - greatly affecting quality of sleep and life. (But with the great trade-off of bringing great, great knowledge into life's secrets.) The glitch originated in the mind. A story was so frightening that the whole body faced death. Need to survive. It found a pattern with no food. Eating. I did not know then, but food is one of the greatest ways to numb the body. More, usually when eating, there is no X pattern for KS3. So there it was. A way of out pain. Because the approach was not of a dhamma student, that is to take the natural truths beyond MY fears and dedicate sincere effort and practice. So in this glitch, the numbing became more and more powerful. The mind's beautiful imagination had taken it to great distance as 10k calories, vomiting, body exhaustion. Numb. Numb. Numb. Full numbing. In KS3 programming, slowly the AI of the bridge between stomach and esophagus began to shaken. The numbing of the herniated disks created the herniation of the stomach. Just as KS2, the disks herniations. They are not static herniations and unchange-able data, but on the contrary. Continously changing, spontaneously regressing, moving, changing, breathing, recovering in sleep. They are part of =. More specifically, they are the result of = dance with gravity. KS3. Low back pain/\"herniated disks.\" The = dance with gravity. (50% =, 50% gravity) Same is KS2. Stomach hernia. The = dance with food and gravity. (50% =, 50% Food and gravity) These are the only 2 natural truths regarding \"diseases\". Dhamma food test (present moment): Truly smell the food - and contemplate on how it will feel, gather enough sati and sampajanna from previous experiences and present sensory feelings to assess. It should be greeted beyond the stories of the mind. A Natural Truth talking to another Natural truth. Body talking to food. The mind used simply for its dhamma purpose. To observe. To experience the binding of the 2 kayas. \"Is the body craving and asking this?\" If anything feels bad, instantly give it up and try another if envinronment permits. Or contemplate not eating anything. Whats gonna happen? You gonna lose some muscles? Shit no.. Dhamma food test 2 - First Bite. Stop after first bite and chew it well. Contemplate it. Dhamma food test 2.1 - Combinations - Eat 2-3 bites and stop for 10 minutes. Test the combinations. Yesterday's rice+curry+omlette experience. Dhamma food test 3 - After meal. Can you lay down and play without any discomfort, at least for an hour? This means you have eaten in close to 100% accordance to = current body alchemy. It's not always have to be so, it is just an indicator. Dhamma food test 4 (on greater vision and current body alchemy study): Introducem Dhamma Food Test -> dupa pauza de 12h+, mananci incet si putin acea mancare pe care vrei s-o testezi. Observi cum te simti in timp ce mananci si 15,30,60,120 min dupa. Dhamma food is highly inter-changing and dependent on envinronment(location, logistics, time, energy) and body. Thus, Dhamma Food Vision is specific to place. Food choice syncronicity with time of day must be considered. For example, coconut brings clear dukkha at night and early morning. But can be enjoyed in the later morning and afternoon. Each time you are eating way past sunset, you are not respecting the night. Not respecting nature. Can KS2 condition KS3? - Most definitely. At least 50%. As they both create powerful vedana an dukkha. But looking closely, low back pain seem to condition stomach dukkha. Not the other way around. When stomach becomes inflamed, it surpasses low back pain in mind's focus in reading body messages. So then - Low back pain Conditions Stomach dukkha (Eating patterns, negative effect, hernia consequencies from cultivated dukkha) First came Low back pain. First the disk hearniated, but mind was unaware. Then mind became aware and everything broke. This instantly created a body-mind unsync. Body and mind straining away from the Natural Truth of togetherness. Of complete trust in each-other. The body couldn't trust the mind anymore - and the mind could not trust the body. Death of a thousand \"I\"s followed. Greatest spiritual and mind suffering ever felt. I was ripped of purpose, joy, relaxation, the pure acts of sitting or watching a bird fly. This great un-sync immediately impacted all other patterns, most being food. And it begin birthing every night. Night after night, taking my pain away. Slowly it sickened the altered the body alchemy away from the Natural Truth. The path back to the Natural Truths. - is no easy path."}
{"prompt": "How do you transform learning into a life journey?", "content": "The Art of Learning has 3 main stages of Alchemy I. The First Learning, II. The Second Learning, III. The Third Learning, and one final Form of a Teaching: IV. Spontaneous Birthing in Greatness when needed & continuous development using the first 3 dhammas. The Art of Learning can enhance up to 10x One\u2019s Learning Rate (and more) and Transferability of Skill to the Real World. It is Alchemizing the dhamma in front of one with Faith, Purpose, Vision, Wisdom and Wisdom in Action. There are, of course, other ways to Learn, just as there are many ways to Move, To Eat, to Live. But we are Students of the Art of Life, emerging from a intimate, inter-connected meeting of all Life\u2019s Arts, each requiring immense sufferings, sincere effort and dedication to unveil. The Art of Breathing, The Art of Eating, The Art of Moving, Lay the Foundation. Today we study The Art of Learning./*************************************************************************/ I. The First Learning: The Scholar In the First Learning, One engages with the lesson as a Scholar \u2013 a first contact with the Teaching, stepping into the space where curiosity and discovery take precedence. This initial engagement brings a fresh sense of observation, yet it moves with shallow neural activations, looking to make high-level connections. The Scholar seeks to bridge these connections with known experiences and past learnings, using high-level neural pathways that remain exploratory and wide, yet underdeveloped. Here, bottlenecks may arise as the Scholar reaches the edges of their current logistical, theory or real-world application understanding, restrained by the unknown and gaps in experience. At this stage, the learning feels like an open field, one where the Scholar\u2019s pen and mind move freely, alternating between the core material and the spontaneous high-level connections that emerge. The Scholar remains rooted in One Question: What skill, what dhamma, is One seeking to develop, and in what dimensions is it to be measured? These insights emerge as the foundation of a multi-dimensional approach, where learning extends beyond itself and into all realms. This is the \"Scholar\" step of the \"Scholar Athlete\" archetype. The \"Pen in one hand\" from the \"Warrior Monk with the Pen in one hand and the Blade in another\" archetype./*************************************************************************/ II. The Second Learning: Deep Integration & Usability across all \u201cI\u201d\u2019s The Second Learning happened this night, as One sits down a second time in front of the Lesson, this time with the Pen & Paper in hand \u2013 and truly scrutinizes the teachings on low levels, allowing spontaneous ramifications of where God takes us, from one lesson to another. The 3am-6am window, clear stomach, beautiful sleep and deeply Cleaned Dojo allows for the Clear Mind to completely Rise. In the Second Learning, the neural paths reach a much higher depth and ease of accessibility for the Mind. Even here, the high-level Sentiment is Code Re-usability. Formatting the learned patterns in ways that can be easily accessible by other Gateways of writings, projects, videos, photos. The Re-usability of the learned concept, code, and dhammas extends into all areas, not limited to Neo \u2013 but going further into the Builder, the Writer, The Healer. In Unity, when One Learns, We all Learn./*****************************************************************************/ III. The Third Learning: The Dojo's Doors Open Towards the Battlefield One gracefully puts down the warm pen and closes the book, heading into the Real World. He first nourishes his body \u2013 the Fighter \u2013 in all realms. Then he begins practicing what he had studied on top of his pre-trained (life-story) Alchemies. There is no clinging to any outcomes, nor are there any emotions affecting the efficiency of the Fighting Beast. Like a samurai walking the battlefield, he uses all of his senses to his advantage. But he is always in the present \u2013 never lost in unnecessary predictions. The Samurai's mind is not predicting from where the opponent might strike, therefore losing present-moment contact with all the senses. So that when a true opponent appears, the Mind must first travel back to the present from its predictions and only from there React. But rather, he remains deeply rooted in the present. The Clear Mind in a Strong, Connected, Water-Flowing body allows the Mind to react at the speed of light (neural electricity) to the ever-changing inputs from the senses. He fights with all his heart \u2013 for all his brothers he left at home, for dreams, for Freedom, for the work of God on this Earth, and the chance to be His soldier, to Fight for a Better World. He does not abandon the battle in fearful sentiments, but rather Retires to the warm Dojo after the battle is won or the Beast is tired. Inside the Dojo walls, he hangs his blade on the wall and allows the Beast to Rest. The \"I\" learning the dhammas had completely played its part. Now it is time to Die and be Born again when it is needed \u2013 Stronger, Faster, Wiser. The Warrior Monk sleeps, as billions of neural patterns fire across the Realms of Theory and Experience inside his Mind - automatically seeking to converge the 2 Realms. \u201cBlessed are you, Lord our God, King of the Universe, for giving me the Strength to Fight and Wisdom to Learn.\u201d"}
{"prompt": "Explore the balance between evolution and consciousness.", "content": "More and more i feel the \"I\" is nothing but.. evolution. Tracing to the beginnings of life (both on earth and to the beginnings of the universe), everything seems like the roll of dices on a big board. Somewhere on this big board, a rock hit a bigger rock at a certain speed and the big rock started spinning. Thousands of ramifications later, water developed. First Life developed. With the only purpose being survival. So it started consuming the environment, learning, unfolding in millions of species. These species, in the timeframe of generations, consumed this environment, slightly changed and adapted it, with each new feature - payed every time a trade-off. It developed speed, but it loses strength. It developed breathing outside water but lose the ability to breath underneath. But to what purpose ? Why do all this? Yes - the science-backed answer is to perfect survival. Find that combinations of genes and frequencies which offers the greatest chance to Survive, Reproduce and Freely consume the environment. Freely consume the environment - what does this mean? Move when you want to move, run when you want to run, eat, reproduce, react to sounds, react to images, react to thunders, simply put: freely consume the environment without any restrictions. So, from the beginning of the spark of life itself (Evolution) - had 3 major purposes, each one dependent on the previous one. Survive. (independent survival) Reproduce. (survival of the species, of the hand of Evolution) Freely Consume the environment. (the act of fully experiencing life) But this implied war between species. Fighting for territory and food. Fighting for Survival and a safe environment to Reproduce. Yet it somehow found a balance, life kept thriving. And thriving, and changing, and evolution was naturally running it's course. In all these trade-off across millennials, a certain species started settling. It traded off climbing and upper body strength, for endurance needed for scaveging, hunting, working. Traded off the running advantage in 4 limbs for bi-pedalism - creating the possibility of the free use of the hands for hundreds of tasks. Traded enormous bursts of strength for short periods of time, for endurance-oriented ones - and so it needed to develop the unique human capability of Sweating. Cooling off. Other mammals can only use 5% (usually the tongue) to cool their body off. We use 100% - but lost the other half of the coin. And on and on and on.. So it changed and changed and partook billions of ramifications.. until something magic happened. Evolution found the greatest trade off. But i do not know what was it traded for. (the missing link) Consciousness. Becoming fully aware of the environment. Becoming fully aware of this body, it's systems and inter-connections to the outer world. The Why is clear. Because it was the greatest skill to evolve. The ultimate weapon, the ultimate cheat needed for survival. This, in a matter of generations, would allow better and better understanding - and furthermore, manipulation of the environment - to our needs. To later falling into the belief and sickness(and lust) of OWNING the environment. So evolution had finally found it. A way to fully neutralise any threats to our 2 main purposes. Survive and reproduce. There is no more life force and focus needed to attain these 2. So only number 3 remains. Freely consume the environment. Do we ? Do we really move when we feel to, rest, talk how we feel to, express emotions, freely express reactions to rain, to love, to hate - or have we lost this ability? Something paradoxical seems to have happened. The moment evolution developed the skill of \"I\", it has lost the ability to freely consume the environment. It has developed to this mad scientist, blinded by his need for survival, who finds the cure to his problems, only to then overdose on it. Is this what the east world has studied and made it their whole teaching's purpose. The birth of \"I\". Of \"mine\". The greatest skill ever developed by Evolution, came with a fatal flaw. Which, if left 'untreated', it seems to inevitably lead to the destruction of the species and more, possibly the world. The great spiritual suffering that births every time the \"I\" births. So evolution came up with another wonderful ace. Religions. All trying to solve evolution's greatest flaw through people language. The language of 'I'. Childstories. But this, again, was not forgiven by the trade-off rule. So the ironic trade-off came as more separations, more wars, more \"I\"-s. But is it not clear that is, but a skill? A part of evolution, a part of life itself, and it has no birth or death. Just like the skill of walking. People walk in thousands of different ways, just like the endless variations of \"I\". But with absolute awareness in both body and mind, a person can change how they walk. Can even stop walking for as long as they want to. Proving that despite the hand of evolution, we can actively change of body's alchemy and frequencies. Walking does not exist as an independent entity, but as a part of a whole. Just so, i believe the \"I\" exists. Who am I ? The lover, the friend, the son, the traveler, the sexual derailed, the frightened child, the fearless warrior, the coach, the writer ? Who ? Just like breathing, kaya sankhara, which the east world considered it played a key part in the birth of \"I\". They all seem but skills, and evolution chooses which one to play continuously. So then, just as in changing other skills and aspects in our life, it feels that the skill of \"I\" can be changed. Can be used as we please. Can birth and die continuously, in alignment to the environment the body is consuming. And it seems that pause between \"I\"-s, where the choosing or not choosing to clinging takes place, is life itself. Evolution itself. God. The universe. It was there long before any \"I\"-s. This is what the east world called spiritual enlightenment. Wise monks had long seen this great trade-off. With the birth of \u201cI\u201d, the skill of \u201cI\u201d, came spiritual suffering. With great power, comes great responsibility. \u201cI\u201d can be practised without any spiritual suffering. Once this is attained, life can return to once again, freely consuming the environment. Anattaa. Nirvana. God\u2019s will."}
