Just like you're absolutely you in your Dodo experience, not fully aware of everything else in your environment, but completely in that experience, so is a mind, body, \"I\" in the real world. When the mind identifies with the body, class, environment, lifetime memories and experiences, and when the body is powered by a \"soul\" or lifeForce, then the patterns begin to unfold. Like a mirror reflecting a reflection. But all this is done under the ever-changing, ever-predicting basis of patterns. The mind analyzes and predicts these patterns to find out how to best survive, how to best joyfully experience the game of life, and how to forge the most suitable destino (destiny) based on the outcome of this prediction. The prediction is done across all dimensions of possible actions before a single thought even reaches conscious awareness. Once it reaches awareness is where illusion and free will arise. Well.. it seems like once the mind reaches \"this\" layer of consciousness many patterns have already started to condition the mind on how to react or think."
